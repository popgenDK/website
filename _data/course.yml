  description: I have employed molecular biology in biomedical research for over 20 years. I have recently switched to utilizing genomics to explore and protect tropical species of conservation concern. Ongoing research work includes sea turtle immunogenetics, microbiome analysis for key marine ecosystems (including coral, seagrass and mangroves), and baseline genetic population structures for white teat sea cucumber, cichlids, corals, and the African elephant.
