  abstract: "Genomic studies of species threatened by extinction are providing crucial information about evolutionary mechanisms and genetic consequences of population declines and bottlenecks. However, to understand how species avoid the extinction vortex, insights can be drawn by studying species that thrive despite past declines. Here, we studied the population genomics of the muskox (Ovibos moschatus), an Ice Age relict that was at the brink of extinction for thousands of years at the end of the Pleistocene yet appears to be thriving today. We analysed 108 whole genomes, including present-day individuals representing the current native range of both muskox subspecies, the white-faced and the barren-ground muskox (O. moschatus wardi and O. moschatus moschatus) and a ~21,000-year-old ancient individual from Siberia. We found that the muskox' demographic history was profoundly shaped by past climate changes and post-glacial re-colonizations. In particular, the white-faced muskox has the lowest genome-wide heterozygosity recorded in an ungulate. Yet, there is no evidence of inbreeding depression in native muskox populations. We hypothesize that this can be explained by the effect of long-term gradual population declines that allowed for purging of strongly deleterious mutations. This study provides insights into how species with a history of population bottlenecks, small population sizes and low genetic diversity survive against all odds. "

  abstract: "Genetic variants causing loss of sucrase-isomaltase (SI) function result in malabsorption of sucrose and starch components and the condition congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). The identified genetic variants causing CSID are very rare in all surveyed populations around the globe, except the Arctic-specific c.273_274delAG loss-of-function (LoF) variant, which is common in the Greenlandic Inuit and other Arctic populations. In these populations, it is, therefore, possible to study people with loss of SI function in an unbiased way to elucidate the physiological function of SI, and investigate both short-term and long-term health effects of reduced small intestinal digestion of sucrose and starch. Importantly, a recent study of the LoF variant in Greenlanders reported that adult homozygous carriers have a markedly healthier metabolic profile. These findings indicate that SI inhibition could potentially improve metabolic health also in individuals not carrying the LoF variant, which is of great interest considering the massive number of individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes worldwide. Therefore, the objectives of this review, are 1) to describe the biological role of SI, 2) to describe the metabolic impact of the Arctic SI LoF variant, 3) to reflect on potential mechanisms linking reduced SI function to metabolic health, and 4) to discuss what knowledge is necessary to properly evaluate whether SI inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for improving cardiometabolic health.

  abstract: "Background: Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are a group of inherited metabolic diseases, which encompass more than 50 different subtypes of pathologies. These disorders are caused by defects in lysosomal enzymes, transporters, and other non-lysosomal proteins. Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is the most common subgroup of lysosomal storage disorders in which the body is unable to properly breakdown mucopolysaccharides. The aim of the present study was to identify novel genes and pathogenic variants in families from diverse regions of Pakistan with clinically diagnosed mucopolysaccharidosis type I and mucopolysaccharidosis type II. Methods: Clinical diagnosis identified 12 with mucopolysaccharidosis I and 2 with mucopolysaccharidosis II in 14 families and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to identify the causative variations in 15 affected individuals. Twenty-two unaffected individuals including parents or normal siblings of patients were also sequenced. Putative causal variants were identified by co-segregation and functional annotation. Results: Analysis of whole genome sequencing data revealed ten novel and six previously reported variants in lysosomal storage disorders-associated genes (IDUA, GALNS, SGSH, GAA, IDS, ALDOB, TRAPPC4, MASP1, SMARCAL, KIAA1109, HERC1, RRAS2) and a novel candidate gene (ABCA5) for lysosomal storage disorder-like phenotypes, which has previously been associated with symptoms strongly related with lysosomal storage disorder in animal models. Conclusion: Multigenic inheritance was found in several families highlighting the importance of searching for homozygous pathogenic variants in several genes also in families with a high degree of consanguinity.

  abstract: "Perturbation of lipid homoeostasis is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death worldwide. We aimed to identify genetic variants affecting lipid levels, and thereby risk of CVD, in Greenlanders. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of six blood lipids, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, as well as apolipoproteins A1 and B, were performed in up to 4473 Greenlanders. For genome-wide significant variants, we also tested for associations with additional traits, including CVD events. We identified 11 genome-wide significant loci associated with lipid traits. Most of these loci were already known in Europeans, however, we found a potential causal variant near PCSK9 (rs12117661), which was independent of the known PCSK9 loss-of-function variant (rs11491147). rs12117661 was associated with lower LDL-cholesterol (βSD(SE) = −0.22 (0.03), p = 6.5 × 10−12) and total cholesterol (−0.17 (0.03), p = 1.1 × 10−8) in the Greenlandic study population. Similar associations were observed in Europeans from the UK Biobank, where the variant was also associated with a lower risk of CVD outcomes. Moreover, rs12117661 was a top eQTL for PCSK9 across tissues in European data from the GTEx portal, and was located in a predicted regulatory element, supporting a possible causal impact on PCSK9 expression. Combined, the 11 GWAS signals explained up to 16.3% of the variance of the lipid traits. This suggests that the genetic architecture of lipid levels in Greenlanders is different from Europeans, with fewer variants explaining the variance. [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. "

  abstract: "The iconic Cape buffalo has experienced several documented population declines in recent history. These declines have been largely attributed to the late 19th century rinderpest pandemic. However, the effect of the rinderpest pandemic on their genetic diversity remains contentious, and other factors that have potentially affected this diversity include environmental changes during the Pleistocene, range expansions and recent human activity. Motivated by this, we present analyses of whole genome sequencing data from 59 individuals from across the Cape buffalo range to assess present-day levels of genome-wide genetic diversity and what factors have influenced these levels. We found that the Cape buffalo has high average heterozygosity overall (0.40%), with the two southernmost populations having significantly lower heterozygosity levels (0.33% and 0.29%) on par with that of the domesticated water buffalo (0.29%). Interestingly, we found that these lower levels are probably due to recent inbreeding (average fraction of runs of homozygosity 23.7% and 19.9%) rather than factors further back in time during the Pleistocene. Moreover, detailed investigations of recent demographic history show that events across the past three centuries were the main drivers of the exceptional loss of genetic diversity in the southernmost populations, coincident with the onset of colonialism in the southern extreme of the Cape buffalo range. Hence, our results add to the growing body of studies suggesting that multiple recent human-mediated impacts during the colonial period caused massive losses of large mammal abundance in southern Africa.

  abstract: "The genetic architecture of antidepressant response is poorly understood. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), exploration of placebo response and the use of sub-scales might provide insights. Here, we investigate the association between PRSs for relevant complex traits and response to vortioxetine treatment and placebo using clinical scales, including sub-scales and self-reported assessments. We collected a clinical test sample of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients treated with vortioxetine (N = 907) or placebo (N = 455) from seven randomized, double-blind, clinical trials. In parallel, we obtained data from an observational web-based study of vortioxetine-treated patients (N = 642) with self-reported response. PRSs for antidepressant response, psychiatric disorders, and symptom traits were derived using summary statistics from well-powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Association tests were performed between the PRSs and treatment response in each of the two test samples and empirical p-values were evaluated. In the clinical test sample, no PRSs were significantly associated with response to vortioxetine treatment or placebo following Bonferroni correction. However, clinically assessed treatment response PRS was nominally associated with vortioxetine treatment and placebo response given by several secondary outcome scales (improvement on HAM-A, HAM-A Psychic Anxiety sub-scale, CPFQ & PDQ), (P ≤ 0.026). Further, higher subjective well-being PRS (P ≤ 0.033) and lower depression PRS (P = 0.01) were nominally associated with higher placebo response. In the self-reported test sample, higher schizophrenia PRS was significantly associated with poorer self-reported response (P = 0.0001). The identified PRSs explain a low proportion of the variance (1.2–5.3%) in placebo and treatment response. Although the results were limited, we believe that PRS associations bear unredeemed potential as a predictor for treatment response, as more well-powered and phenotypically similar GWAS bases become available.

  abstract: "African wild pigs have a contentious evolutionary and biogeographic history. Until recently, desert warthog (Phacochoerus aethiopicus) and common warthog (P. africanus) were considered a single species. Molecular evidence surprisingly suggested they diverged at least 4.4 million years ago, and possibly outside of Africa. We sequenced the first whole-genomes of four desert warthogs and 35 common warthogs from throughout their range. We show that these two species diverged much later than previously estimated, 400,000-1,700,000 years ago depending on assumptions of gene flow. This brings it into agreement with the paleontological record. We found that the common warthog originated in western Africa and subsequently colonized eastern and southern Africa. During this range expansion, the common warthog interbred with the desert warthog, presumably in eastern Africa, underlining this region's importance in African biogeography. We found that immune system-related genes may have adaptively introgressed into common warthogs, indicating that resistance to novel diseases was one of the most potent drivers of evolution as common warthogs expanded their range. Hence, we solve some of the key controversies surrounding warthog evolution and reveal a complex evolutionary history involving range expansion, introgression, and adaptation to new diseases.  "

  abstract: "Being able to assign sex to individuals and identify autosomal and sex-linked scaffolds are essential in most population genomic analyses. Non-model organisms often have genome assemblies at scaffold-level and lack characterization of sex-linked scaffolds. Previous methods to identify sex and sex-linked scaffolds have relied on synteny between the non-model organism and a closely related species or prior knowledge about the sex of the samples to identify sex-linked scaffolds. In the latter case, the difference in depth of coverage between the autosomes and the sex chromosomes are used. Here, we present “sex assignment through coverage” (SATC), a method to assign sex to samples and identify sex-linked scaffolds from next generation sequencing (NGS) data. The method works for species with a homogametic/heterogametic sex determination system and only requires a scaffold-level reference assembly and sampling of both sexes with whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. We use the sequencing depth distribution across scaffolds to jointly identify: (i) male and female individuals, and (ii) sex-linked scaffolds. This is achieved through projecting the scaffold depths into a low-dimensional space using principal component analysis (PCA) and subsequent Gaussian mixture clustering. We demonstrate the applicability of our method using data from five mammal species and a bird species complex. The method is freely available at https://github.com/popgenDK/SATC as R code and a graphical user interface (GUI). "

  abstract: "The site frequency spectrum is an important summary statistic in population genetics used for inference on demographic history and selection. However, estimation of the site frequency spectrum from called genotypes introduces bias when working with low-coverage sequencing data. Methods exist for addressing this issue but sometimes suffer from 2 problems. First, they can have very high computational demands, to the point that it may not be possible to run estimation for genome-scale data. Second, existing methods are prone to overfitting, especially for multidimensional site frequency spectrum estimation. In this article, we present a stochastic expectation–maximization algorithm for inferring the site frequency spectrum from NGS data that address these challenges. We show that this algorithm greatly reduces runtime and enables estimation with constant, trivial RAM usage. Furthermore, the algorithm reduces overfitting and thereby improves downstream inference. An implementation is available at github.com/malthesr/winsfs. "

  abstract: "Association studies using genetic data from SNP-chip-based imputation or low-depth sequencing data provide a cost-efficient design for large-scale association studies. We explore methods for performing association studies applicable to such genetic data and investigate how using different priors when estimating genotype probabilities affects the association results. Our proposed method, ANGSD-asso’s latent model, models the unobserved genotype as a latent variable in a generalized linear model framework. The software is implemented in C/Cþþ and can be run multi-threaded. ANGSD-asso is based on genotype probabilities, which can be estimated using either the sample allele frequency or the individual allele frequencies as a prior. We explore through simulations how genotype probability-based methods compare with using genetic dosages. Our simulations show that in a structured population using the individual allele frequency prior has better power than the sample allele frequency. In scenarios with sequencing depth and phenotype correlation ANGSD-asso’s latent model has higher statistical power and less bias than using dosages. Adding additional covariates to the linear model of ANGSD-asso’s latent model has higher statistical power and less bias than other methods that accommodate genotype uncertainty, while also being much faster. This is shown with imputed data from UK Biobank and simulations. "

  abstract: "Type I interferons (IFN-I) play a critical role in human antiviral immunity, as demonstrated by the exceptionally rare deleterious variants of IFNAR1 or IFNAR2. We investigated five children from Greenland, Canada, and Alaska presenting with viral diseases, including life-threatening COVID-19 or influenza, in addition to meningoencephalitis and/or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis following live-attenuated viral vaccination. The affected individuals bore the same homozygous IFNAR2 c.157T>C, p.Ser53Pro missense variant. Although absent from reference databases, p.Ser53Pro occurred with a minor allele frequency of 0.034 in their Inuit ancestry. The serine to proline substitution prevented cell surface expression of IFNAR2 protein, small amounts of which persisted intracellularly in an aberrantly glycosylated state. Cells exclusively expressing the p.Ser53Pro variant lacked responses to recombinant IFN-I and displayed heightened vulnerability to multiple viruses in vitro—a phenotype rescued by wild-type IFNAR2 complementation. This novel form of autosomal recessive IFNAR2 deficiency reinforces the essential role of IFN-I in viral immunity. Further studies are warranted to assess the need for population screening. "

  abstract: "A better understanding of the biological factors underlying antidepressant treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) is needed. We perform gene expression analyses and explore sources of variability in peripheral blood related to antidepressant treatment and treatment response in patients suffering from recurrent MDD at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. The study includes 281 patients, which were randomized to 8 weeks of treatment with vortioxetine (N = 184) or placebo (N = 97). To our knowledge, this is the largest dataset including both gene expression in blood and placebo-controlled treatment response measured by a clinical scale in a randomized clinical trial. We identified three novel genes whose RNA expression levels at baseline and week 8 are significantly (FDR < 0.05) associated with treatment response after 8 weeks of treatment. Among these genes were SOCS3 (FDR = 0.0039) and PROK2 (FDR = 0.0028), which have previously both been linked to depression. Downregulation of these genes was associated with poorer treatment response. We did not identify any genes that were differentially expressed between placebo and vortioxetine groups at week 8 or between baseline and week 8 of treatment. Nor did we replicate any genes identified in previous peripheral blood gene expression studies examining treatment response. Analysis of genome-wide expression variability showed that type of treatment and treatment response explains very little of the variance, a median of <0.0001% and 0.05% in gene expression across all genes, respectively. Given the relatively large size of the study, the limited findings suggest that peripheral blood gene expression might not be the best approach to explore the biological factors underlying antidepressant treatment.

  abstract: "Paroxetine and sertraline are the only FDA approved drugs for treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although both drugs show better outcomes than placebo, not all patients benefit from treatment. We examined predictors and latent classes of SSRI treatment response in patients with PTSD. Symptom severity was measured over a 12-week period in 390 patients suffering from PTSD treated with open-label sertraline or paroxetine and a double-blinded placebo. First, growth curve modeling (GCM) was used to examine population-level predictors of treatment response. Second, growth mixture modeling (GMM) was used to group patients into latent classes based on their treatment response trajectories over time and to investigate predictors of latent class membership. Gender, childhood sexual trauma, and sexual assault as index trauma moderated the population-level treatment response using GCM. GMM identified three classes: fast responders, responders with low pretreatment symptom severity and responders with high pretreatment symptom severity. Class membership was predicted based on time since index trauma, severity of depression, and severity of anxiety. The study shows that higher severity of comorbid disorders does not result in an inferior response to treatment and suggests that patients with longer time since index trauma might particularly benefit from treatment with sertraline or paroxetine.

  abstract: "The Inuit ancestors of the Greenlandic people arrived in Greenland close to 1,000 years ago.1 Since then, Europeans from many different countries have been present in Greenland. Consequently, the present-day Greenlandic population has ∼25% of its genetic ancestry from Europe.2 In this study, we investigated to what extent different European countries have contributed to this genetic ancestry. We combined dense SNP chip data from 3,972 Greenlanders and 8,275 Europeans from 14 countries and inferred the ancestry contribution from each of these 14 countries using haplotype-based methods. Due to the rapid increase in population size in Greenland over the past ∼100 years, we hypothesized that earlier European interactions, such as pre-colonial Dutch whalers and early German and Danish-Norwegian missionaries, as well as the later Danish colonists and post-colonial immigrants, all contributed European genetic ancestry. However, we found that the European ancestry is almost entirely Danish and that a substantial fraction is from admixture that took place within the last few generations. "

  abstract: "Grant's gazelles have recently been proposed to be a species complex comprising three highly divergent mtDNA lineages (Nanger granti, N. notata and N. petersii). The three lineages have nonoverlapping distributions in East Africa, but without any obvious geographical divisions, making them an interesting model for studying the early-stage evolutionary dynamics of allopatric speciation in detail. Here, we use genomic data obtained by restriction site-associated (RAD) sequencing of 106 gazelle individuals to shed light on the evolutionary processes underlying Grant's gazelle divergence, to characterize their genetic structure and to assess the presence of gene flow between the main lineages in the species complex. We date the species divergence to 134,000 years ago, which is recent in evolutionary terms. We find population subdivision within N. granti, which coincides with the previously suggested two subspecies, N. g. granti and N. g. robertsii. Moreover, these two lineages seem to have hybridized in Masai Mara. Perhaps more surprisingly given their extreme genetic differentiation, N. granti and N. petersii also show signs of prolonged admixture in Mkomazi, which we identified as a hybrid population most likely founded by allopatric lineages coming into secondary contact. Despite the admixed composition of this population, elevated X chromosomal differentiation suggests that selection may be shaping the outcome of hybridization in this population. Our results therefore provide detailed insights into the processes of allopatric speciation and secondary contact in a recently radiated species complex. "

  abstract: "Background: Identification of selection signatures between populations is often an important part of a population genetic study. Leveraging high-throughput DNA sequencing larger sample sizes of populations with similar ancestries has become increasingly common. This has led to the need of methods capable of identifying signals of selection in populations with a continuous cline of genetic differentiation. Individuals from continuous populations are inherently challenging to group into meaningful units which is why existing methods rely on principal components analysis for inference of the selection signals. These existing methods require called genotypes as input which is problematic for studies based on low-coverage sequencing data. Materials and methods: We have extended two principal component analysis based selection statistics to genotype likelihood data and applied them to low-coverage sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project for populations with European and East Asian ancestry to detect signals of selection in samples with continuous population structure. Results: Here, we present two selections statistics which we have implemented in the PCAngsd framework. These methods account for genotype uncertainty, opening for the opportunity to conduct selection scans in continuous populations from low and/or variable coverage sequencing data. To illustrate their use, we applied the methods to low-coverage sequencing data from human populations of East Asian and European ancestries and show that the implemented selection statistics can control the false positive rate and that they identify the same signatures of selection from low-coverage sequencing data as state-of-the-art software using high quality called genotypes. Conclusion: We show that selection scans of low-coverage sequencing data of populations with similar ancestry perform on par with that obtained from high quality genotype data. Moreover, we demonstrate that PCAngsd outperform selection statistics obtained from called genotypes from low-coverage sequencing data without the need for ad-hoc filtering. "

  abstract: "Large carnivores are generally sensitive to ecosystem changes because their specialized diet and position at the top of the trophic pyramid is associated with small population sizes. Accordingly, low genetic diversity at the whole-genome level has been reported for all big cat species, including the widely distributed leopard. However, all previous whole-genome analyses of leopards are based on the Far Eastern Amur leopards that live at the extremity of the species’ distribution and therefore are not necessarily representative of the whole species. We sequenced 53 whole genomes of African leopards. Strikingly, we found that the genomic diversity in the African leopard is 2- to 5-fold higher than in other big cats, including the Amur leopard, likely because of an exceptionally high effective population size maintained by the African leopard throughout the Pleistocene. Furthermore, we detected ongoing gene flow and very low population differentiation within African leopards compared with those of other big cats. We corroborated this by showing a complete absence of an otherwise ubiquitous equatorial forest barrier to gene flow. This sets the leopard apart from most other widely distributed large African mammals, including lions. These results revise our understanding of trophic sensitivity and highlight the remarkable resilience of the African leopard, likely because of its extraordinary habitat versatility and broad dietary niche.

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: The common muscle-specific TBC1D4 p.Arg684Ter loss-of-function variant defines a subtype of non-autoimmune diabetes in Arctic populations. Homozygous carriers are characterised by elevated postprandial glucose and insulin levels. Because 3.8% of the Greenlandic population are homozygous carriers, it is important to explore possibilities for precision medicine. We aimed to investigate whether physical activity attenuates the effect of this variant on 2 h plasma glucose levels after an oral glucose load. Methods: In a Greenlandic population cohort (n = 2655), 2 h plasma glucose levels were obtained after an OGTT, physical activity was estimated as physical activity energy expenditure and TBC1D4 genotype was determined. We performed TBC1D4–physical activity interaction analysis, applying a linear mixed model to correct for genetic admixture and relatedness. Results: Physical activity was inversely associated with 2 h plasma glucose levels (β[main effect of physical activity] −0.0033 [mmol/l] / [kJ kg−1 day−1], p = 6.5 × 10−5), and significantly more so among homozygous carriers of the TBC1D4 risk variant compared with heterozygous carriers and non-carriers (β[interaction] −0.015 [mmol/l] / [kJ kg−1 day−1], p = 0.0085). The estimated effect size suggests that 1 h of vigorous physical activity per day (compared with resting) reduces 2 h plasma glucose levels by an additional ~0.7 mmol/l in homozygous carriers of the risk variant. Conclusions/interpretation: Physical activity improves glucose homeostasis particularly in homozygous TBC1D4 risk variant carriers via a skeletal muscle TBC1 domain family member 4-independent pathway. This provides a rationale to implement physical activity as lifestyle precision medicine in Arctic populations.

  abstract: "Genotyping-by-sequencing methods such as RADseq are popular for generating genomic and population-scale data sets from a diverse range of organisms. These often lack a usable reference genome, restricting users to RADseq specific software for processing. However, these come with limitations compared to generic next generation sequencing (NGS) toolkits. Here, we describe and test a simple pipeline for reference-free RADseq data processing that blends de novo elements from STACKS with the full suite of state-of-the art NGS tools. Specifically, we use the de novo RADseq assembly employed by STACKS to create a catalogue of RAD loci that serves as a reference for read mapping, variant calling and site filters. Using RADseq data from 28 zebra sequenced to ~8x depth-of-coverage we evaluate our approach by comparing the site frequency spectra (SFS) to those from alternative pipelines. Most pipelines yielded similar SFS at 8x depth, but only a genotype likelihood based pipeline performed similarly at low sequencing depth (2–4x). We compared the RADseq SFS with medium-depth (~13x) shotgun sequencing of eight overlapping samples, revealing that the RADseq SFS was persistently slightly skewed towards rare and invariant alleles. Using simulations and human data we confirm that this is expected when there is allelic dropout (AD) in the RADseq data. AD in the RADseq data caused a heterozygosity deficit of ~16%, which dropped to ~5% after filtering AD. Hence, AD was the most important source of bias in our RADseq data. "

  abstract: "Motivation: Principal component analysis (PCA) is a commonly used tool in genetics to capture and visualize population structure. Due to technological advances in sequencing, such as the widely used non-invasive prenatal test, massive datasets of ultra-low coverage sequencing are being generated. These datasets are characterized by having a large amount of missing genotype information. Results: We present EMU, a method for inferring population structure in the presence of rampant non-random missingness. We show through simulations that several commonly used PCA methods cannot handle missing data arisen from various sources, which leads to biased results as individuals are projected into the PC space based on their amount of missingness. In terms of accuracy, EMU outperforms an existing method that also accommodates missingness while being competitively fast. We further tested EMU on around 100K individuals of the Phase 1 dataset of the Chinese Millionome Project, that were shallowly sequenced to around 0.08×. From this data we are able to capture the population structure of the Han Chinese and to reproduce previous analysis in a matter of CPU hours instead of CPU years. EMU's capability to accurately infer population structure in the presence of missingness will be of increasing importance with the rising number of large-scale genetic datasets.  "

  abstract: "Estimation of relatedness between pairs of individuals is important in many genetic research areas. When estimating relatedness, it is important to account for admixture if this is present. However, the methods that can account for admixture are all based on genotype data as input, which is a problem for low-depth next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from which genotypes are called with high uncertainty. Here, we present a software tool, NGSremix, for maximum likelihood estimation of relatedness between pairs of admixed individuals from low-depth NGS data, which takes the uncertainty of the genotypes into account via genotype likelihoods. Using both simulated and real NGS data for admixed individuals with an average depth of 4x or below we show that our method works well and clearly outperforms all the commonly used state-of-the-art relatedness estimation methods PLINK, KING, relateAdmix, and ngsRelate that all perform quite poorly. Hence, NGSremix is a useful new tool for estimating relatedness in admixed populations from low-depth NGS data.

  abstract: "Model based methods for genetic clustering of individuals, such as those implemented in structure or ADMIXTURE, allow the user to infer individual ancestries and study population structure. The underlying model makes several assumptions about the demographic history that shaped the analysed genetic data. One assumption is that all individuals are a result of K homogeneous ancestral populations that are all well represented in the data, while another assumption is that no drift happened after the admixture event. The histories of many real world populations do not conform to that model, and in that case taking the inferred admixture proportions at face value might be misleading. We propose a method to evaluate the fit of admixture models based on estimating the correlation of the residual difference between the true genotypes and the genotypes predicted by the model. When the model assumptions are not violated, the residuals from a pair of individuals are not correlated. In the case of a bad fitting admixture model, individuals with similar demographic histories have a positive correlation of their residuals. Using simulated and real data, we show how the method is able to detect a bad fit of inferred admixture proportions due to using an insufficient number of clusters K or to demographic histories that deviate significantly from the admixture model assumptions, such as admixture from ghost populations, drift after admixture events and nondiscrete ancestral populations. We have implemented the method as an open source software that can be applied to both unphased genotypes and low depth sequencing data. "

  abstract: "The maritime expansion of Scandinavian populations during the Viking Age (about ad 750–1050) was a far-flung transformation in world history1,2. Here we sequenced the genomes of 442 humans from archaeological sites across Europe and Greenland (to a median depth of about 1×) to understand the global influence of this expansion. We find the Viking period involved gene flow into Scandinavia from the south and east. We observe genetic structure within Scandinavia, with diversity hotspots in the south and restricted gene flow within Scandinavia. We find evidence for a major influx of Danish ancestry into England; a Swedish influx into the Baltic; and Norwegian influx into Ireland, Iceland and Greenland. Additionally, we see substantial ancestry from elsewhere in Europe entering Scandinavia during the Viking Age. Our ancient DNA analysis also revealed that a Viking expedition included close family members. By comparing with modern populations, we find that pigmentation-associated loci have undergone strong population differentiation during the past millennium, and trace positively selected loci—including the lactase-persistence allele of LCT and alleles of ANKA that are associated with the immune response—in detail. We conclude that the Viking diaspora was characterized by substantial transregional engagement: distinct populations influenced the genomic makeup of different regions of Europe, and Scandinavia experienced increased contact with the rest of the continent.

  abstract: "Background and aims: No prospective study have ever assessed if marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids protect Inuit against cardiovascular disease as claimed. It is highly relevant as cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence rates are rising concurrent with a westernization of diet. We aimed to assess the association between blood cell membrane phospholipid content of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (EPA + DHA) on CVD risk in Inuit. Methods: We used data from a cohort of adult Greenlanders with follow-up in national registers. The main outcome was fatal and non-fatal CVD incidence among participants without previous CVD. The continuous effect of EPA + DHA was calculated as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using Poisson regression with age as time scale, adjusting for age, sex, genetic admixture, lifestyle and dietary risk factors. Results: Out of 3095 eligible participants, 2924 were included. During a median follow-up of 9.7 years, 216 had their first CVD event (8.3 events/1000 person years). No association between EPA + DHA and CVD risk was seen, with IRR = 0.99 per percentage point EPA + DHA increase (95% CI: 0.95–1.03, p = 0.59). No association was seen with risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) (IRR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.97–1.09) and stroke (IRR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.93–1.03) as separate outcomes or for intake of EPA and DHA. Conclusions: We can exclude that the CVD risk reduction is larger than 21% for individuals at the 75% EPA + DHA percentile compared to the 25% percentile. We need a larger sample size and/or longer follow-up to detect smaller effects and associations with IHD and/or stroke. "

  abstract: "The genetic architecture of the small and isolated Greenlandic population is advantageous for identification of novel genetic variants associated with cardio-metabolic traits. We aimed to identify genetic loci associated with body mass index (BMI), to expand the knowledge of the genetic and biological mechanisms underlying obesity. Stage 1 BMI-association analyses were performed in 4,626 Greenlanders. Stage 2 replication and meta-analysis were performed in additional cohorts comprising 1,058 Yup’ik Alaska Native people, and 1,529 Greenlanders. Obesity-related traits were assessed in the stage 1 study population. We identified a common variant on chromosome 11, rs4936356, where the derived G-allele had a frequency of 24% in the stage 1 study population. The derived allele was genome-wide significantly associated with lower BMI (beta (SE), -0.14 SD (0.03), p = 3.2x10-8), corresponding to 0.64 kg/m2 lower BMI per G allele in the stage 1 study population. We observed a similar effect in the Yup’ik cohort (-0.09 SD, p = 0.038), and a non-significant effect in the same direction in the independent Greenlandic stage 2 cohort (-0.03 SD, p = 0.514). The association remained genome-wide significant in meta-analysis of the Arctic cohorts (-0.10 SD (0.02), p = 4.7x10-8). Moreover, the variant was associated with a leaner body type (weight, -1.68 (0.37) kg; waist circumference, -1.52 (0.33) cm; hip circumference, -0.85 (0.24) cm; lean mass, -0.84 (0.19) kg; fat mass and percent, -1.66 (0.33) kg and -1.39 (0.27) %; visceral adipose tissue, -0.30 (0.07) cm; subcutaneous adipose tissue, -0.16 (0.05) cm, all p<0.0002), lower insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, -0.12 (0.04), p = 0.00021), and favorable lipid levels (triglyceride, -0.05 (0.02) mmol/l, p = 0.025; HDL-cholesterol, 0.04 (0.01) mmol/l, p = 0.0015). In conclusion, we identified a novel variant, where the derived G-allele possibly associated with lower BMI in Arctic populations, and as a consequence also leaner body type, lower insulin resistance, and a favorable lipid profile.

  abstract: "Estimating total narrow-sense heritability in admixed populations remains an open question. In this work, we used extensive simulations to evaluate existing linear mixed-model frameworks for estimating total narrow-sense heritability in two population-based cohorts from Greenland, and compared the results with data from unadmixed individuals from Denmark. When our analysis focused on Greenlandic sib pairs, and under the assumption that shared environment among siblings has a negligible effect, the model with two relationship matrices, one capturing identity by descent and one capturing identity by state, returned heritability estimates close to the true simulated value, while using each of the two matrices alone led to downward biases. When phenotypes correlated with ancestry, heritability estimates were inflated. Based on these observations, we propose a PCA-based adjustment that recovers the true simulated heritability. We use this knowledge to estimate the heritability of ten quantitative traits from the two Greenlandic cohorts, and report differences such as lower heritability for height in Greenlanders compared with Europeans. In conclusion, narrow-sense heritability in admixed populations is best estimated when using a mixture of genetic relationship matrices on individuals with at least one first-degree relative included in the sample.

  abstract: "Several recent studies have found signs of recent selection on the carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A) gene in the ancestors of Arctic populations likely as a result of their traditional diet. CPT1A is involved in fatty acid transportation and is known to affect circulating fatty acid profiles in Inuit as does the unique traditional diet rich in marine animals. We aimed to assess which fatty acids may have driven the selection of rs80356779, a c.1436C>T (p.(Pro479Leu)) variant in CPT1A, by analyzing a potential interaction between the variant and traditional Inuit diet. We included 3005 genome-wide genotyped individuals living in Greenland, who had blood cell membrane fatty acid levels measured. Consumption of 25 traditional food items was expressed as percentage of total energy intake. We tested for CPT1A × traditional diet interaction while taking relatedness and admixture into account. Increasing intakes of traditional diet was estimated to attenuate the effect of 479L on 20:3 omega-6 levels (p = 0.000399), but increase the effect of the variant on 22:5 omega-3 levels (p = 0.000963). The 479L effect on 22:5 omega-3 more than doubled in individuals with a high intake of traditional diet (90% percentile) compared with individuals with a low intake (10% percentile). Similar results were found when assessing interactions with marine foods. Our results suggest that the association between traditional diet and blood cell fatty acid composition is affected by the CPT1A genotype, or other variants in linkage disequilibrium, and support the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acids may have been important for adaptation to the Arctic diet.

  abstract: "Motivation: The presence of present-day human contaminating DNA fragments is one of the challenges defining ancient DNA (aDNA) research. This is especially relevant to the ancient human DNA field where it is difficult to distinguish endogenous molecules from human contaminants due to their genetic similarity. Recently, with the advent of high-throughput sequencing and new aDNA protocols, hundreds of ancient human genomes have become available. Contamination in those genomes has been measured with computational methods often developed specifically for these empirical studies. Consequently, some of these methods have not been implemented and tested for general use while few are aimed at low-depth nuclear data, a common feature in aDNA datasets. Results: We develop a new X-chromosome-based maximum likelihood method for estimating present-day human contamination in low-depth sequencing data from male individuals. We implement our method for general use, assess its performance under conditions typical of ancient human DNA research, and compare it to previous nuclear data-based methods through extensive simulations. For low-depth data, we show that existing methods can produce unusable estimates or substantially underestimate contamination. In contrast, our method provides accurate estimates for a depth of coverage as low as 0.5× on the X-chromosome when contamination is below 25%. Moreover, our method still yields meaningful estimates in very challenging situations, i.e. when the contaminant and the target come from closely related populations or with increased error rates. With a running time below 5 min, our method is applicable to large scale aDNA genomic studies. "

  abstract: "Background: Recent computational advances in ancient DNA research have opened access to the detection of ancient DNA methylation footprints at the genome-wide scale. The most commonly used approach infers the methylation state of a given genomic region on the basis of the amount of nucleotide mis-incorporations observed at CpG dinucleotide sites. However, this approach overlooks a number of confounding factors, including the presence of sequencing errors and true variants. The scale and distribution of the inferred methylation measurements are also variable across samples, precluding direct comparisons. Findings: Here, we present DamMet, an open-source software program retrieving maximum likelihood estimates of regional CpG methylation levels from ancient DNA sequencing data. It builds on a novel statistical model of post-mortem DNA damage for dinucleotides, accounting for sequencing errors, genotypes, and differential post-mortem cytosine deamination rates at both methylated and unmethylated sites. To validate DamMet, we extended gargammel, a sequence simulator for ancient DNA data, by introducing methylation-dependent features of post-mortem DNA decay. This new simulator provides direct validation of DamMet predictions. Additionally, the methylation levels inferred by DamMet were found to be correlated to those inferred by epiPALEOMIX and both on par and directly comparable to those measured from whole-genome bisulphite sequencing experiments of fresh tissues. Conclusions: DamMet provides genuine estimates for local DNA methylation levels in ancient individual genomes. The returned estimates are directly cross-sample comparable, and the software is available as an open-source C++ program hosted at https://gitlab.com/KHanghoj/DamMet along with a manual and tutorial.

  abstract: "During the last decade genome-wide association studies have proven to be a powerful approach to identifying disease-causing variants. However, for admixed populations, most current methods for association testing are based on the assumption that the effect of a genetic variant is the same regardless of its ancestry. This is a reasonable assumption for a causal variant but may not hold for the genetic variants that are tested in genome-wide association studies, which are usually not causal. The effects of noncausal genetic variants depend on how strongly their presence correlate with the presence of the causal variant, which may vary between ancestral populations because of different linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequencies. Motivated by this, we here introduce a new statistical method for association testing in recently admixed populations, where the effect size is allowed to depend on the ancestry of a given allele. Our method does not rely on accurate inference of local ancestry, yet using simulations we show that in some scenarios it gives a substantial increase in statistical power to detect associations. In addition, the method allows for testing for difference in effect size between ancestral populations, which can be used to help determine if a given genetic variant is causal. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method on data from the Greenlandic population. "

Here, we present m7G Mutational Profiling sequencing (m7G-MaP-seq), which allows high throughput detection of m7G modifications at nucleotide resolution. In our method, m7G modified positions are converted to abasic sites by reduction with sodium borohydride, directly recorded as cDNA mutations through reverse transcription and sequenced. We detect positions with increased mutation rates in the reduced and control samples taking the possibility of sequencing/alignment error into account and use replicates to calculate statistical significance based on log likelihood ratio tests. We show that m7G-MaP-seq efficiently detects known m7G modifications in rRNA with mutational rates up to 25% and we map a previously uncharacterised evolutionarily conserved rRNA modification at position 1581 in Arabidopsis thaliana SSU rRNA. Furthermore, we identify m7G modifications in budding yeast, human and arabidopsis tRNAs and demonstrate that m7G modification occurs before tRNA splicing. We do not find any evidence for internal m7G modifications being present in other small RNA, such as miRNA, snoRNA and sRNA, including human Let-7e. Likewise, high sequencing depth m7G-MaP-seq analysis of mRNA from E. coli or yeast cells did not identify any internal m7G modifications.  "

  abstract: "Knowledge of how individuals are related is important in many areas of research, and numerous methods for inferring pairwise relatedness from genetic data have been developed. However, the majority of these methods were not developed for situations where data are limited. Specifically, most methods rely on the availability of population allele frequencies, the relative genomic position of variants and accurate genotype data. But in studies of non-model organisms or ancient samples, such data are not always available. Motivated by this, we present a new method for pairwise relatedness inference, which requires neither allele frequency information nor information on genomic position. Furthermore, it can be applied not only to accurate genotype data but also to low-depth sequencing data from which genotypes cannot be accurately called. We evaluate it using data from a range of human populations and show that it can be used to infer close familial relationships with a similar accuracy as a widely used method that relies on population allele frequencies. Additionally, we show that our method is robust to SNP ascertainment and applicable to low-depth sequencing data generated using different strategies, including resequencing and RADseq, which is important for application to a diverse range of populations and species.

  abstract: "Capsicum is one of the major vegetable crops grown worldwide. Current subdivision in clades and species is based on morphological traits and coarse sets of genetic markers. Broad variability of fruits has been driven by breeding programs and has been mainly studied by linkage analysis. We discovered 746k variable sites by sequencing 1.8% of the genome in a collection of 373 accessions belonging to 11 Capsicum species from 51 countries. We describe genomic variation at population-level, confirm major subdivision in clades and species, and show that the known major subdivision of C. annuum separates large and bulky fruits from small ones. In C. annuum, we identify four novel loci associated with phenotypes determining the fruit shape, including a non-synonymous mutation in the gene Longifolia 1-like (CA03g16080). Our collection covers all the economically important species of Capsicum widely used in breeding programs and represent the widest and largest study so far in terms of the number of species and number of genetic variants analyzed. We identified a large set of markers that can be used for population genetic studies and genetic association analyses. Our results provide a comprehensive and precise perspective on genomic variability in Capsicum at population-level and suggest that future fine genetic association studies will yield useful results for breeding.

  abstract: "Testing for deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) is a common practice for quality control in genetic studies. Variable sites violating HWE may be identified as technical errors in the sequencing or genotyping process, or they may be of particular evolutionary interest. Large-scale genetic studies based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods have become more prevalent as cost is decreasing but these methods are still associated with statistical uncertainty. The large-scale studies usually consist of samples from diverse ancestries that make the existence of some degree of population structure almost inevitable. Precautions are therefore needed when analysing these data set, as population structure causes deviations from HWE. Here we propose a method that takes population structure into account in the testing for HWE, such that other factors causing deviations from HWE can be detected. We show the effectiveness of PCAngsd in low-depth NGS data, as well as in genotype data, for both simulated and real data set, where the use of genotype likelihoods enables us to model the uncertainty.

  abstract: "The detection of ancient gene flow between human populations is an important issue in population genetics. A common tool for detecting ancient admixture events is the D-statistic. The D-statistic is based on the hypothesis of a genetic relationship that involves four populations, whose correctness is assessed by evaluating specific coincidences of alleles between the groups. When working with high-throughput sequencing data, calling genotypes accurately is not always possible; therefore, the D-statistic currently samples a single base from the reads of one individual per population. This implies ignoring much of the information in the data, an issue especially striking in the case of ancient genomes. We provide a significant improvement to overcome the problems of the D-statistic by considering all reads from multiple individuals in each population. We also apply type-specific error correction to combat the problems of sequencing errors, and show a way to correct for introgression from an external population that is not part of the supposed genetic relationship, and how this leads to an estimate of the admixture rate. We prove that the D-statistic is approximated by a standard normal distribution. Furthermore, we show that our method outperforms the traditional D-statistic in detecting admixtures. The power gain is most pronounced for low and medium sequencing depth (1-10·), and performances are as good as with perfectly called genotypes at a sequencing depth of 2·.We show the reliability of error correction in scenarios with simulated errors and ancient data, and correct for introgression in known scenarios to estimate the admixture rates.

  abstract: "Despite broad agreement that the Americas were initially populated via Beringia, the land bridge that connected far northeast Asia with northwestern North America during the Pleistocene epoch, when and how the peopling of the Americas occurred remains unresolved. Analyses of human remains from Late Pleistocene Alaska are important to resolving the timing and dispersal of these populations. The remains of two infants were recovered at Upward Sun River (USR), and have been dated to around 11.5 thousand years ago (ka). Here, by sequencing the USR1 genome to an average coverage of approximately 17 times, we show that USR1 is most closely related to Native Americans, but falls basal to all previously sequenced contemporary and ancient Native Americans. As such, USR1 represents a distinct Ancient Beringian population. Using demographic modelling, we infer that the Ancient Beringian population and ancestors of other Native Americans descended from a single founding population that initially split from East Asians around 36 ± 1.5 ka, with gene flow persisting until around 25 ± 1.1 ka. Gene flow from ancient north Eurasians into all Native Americans took place 25-20 ka, with Ancient Beringians branching off around 22-18.1 ka. Our findings support a long-term genetic structure in ancestral Native Americans, consistent with the Beringian 'standstill model'. We show that the basal northern and southern Native American branches, to which all other Native Americans belong, diverged around 17.5-14.6 ka, and that this probably occurred south of the North American ice sheets. We also show that after 11.5 ka, some of the northern Native American populations received gene flow from a Siberian population most closely related to Koryaks, but not Palaeo-Eskimos, Inuits or Kets, and that Native American gene flow into Inuits was through northern and not southern Native American groups. Our findings further suggest that the far-northern North American presence of northern Native Americans is from a back migration that replaced or absorbed the initial founding population of Ancient Beringians.

The aim of the current study was to identify additional genetic variation underlying type 2 diabetes using a recessive genetic model, thereby increasing the power to detect variants with recessive effects. Methods: We investigated three cohorts of Greenlanders (B99, n = 1401; IHIT, n = 3115; and BBH, n = 547), which were genotyped using Illumina MetaboChip. Of the 4674 genotyped individuals passing quality control, 4648 had phenotype data available, and type 2 diabetes association analyses were performed for 317 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 2631 participants with normal glucose tolerance. Statistical association analyses were performed using a linear mixed model. Results: Using a recessive genetic model, we identified two novel loci associated with type 2 diabetes in Greenlanders, namely rs870992 in ITGA1 on chromosome 5 (OR 2.79, p = 1.8 × 10                             −8                             ), and rs16993330 upstream of LARGE1 on chromosome 22 (OR 3.52, p = 1.3 × 10                             −7                             ). The LARGE1 variant did not reach the conventional threshold for genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10                             −8                             ) but did withstand a study-wide Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold. Both variants were common in Greenlanders, with minor allele frequencies of 23% and 16%, respectively, and were estimated to have large recessive effects on risk of type 2 diabetes in Greenlanders, compared with additively inherited variants previously observed in European populations. Conclusions/interpretation: We demonstrate the value of using a recessive genetic model in a historically small and isolated population to identify genetic risk variants. Our findings give new insights into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes, and further support the existence of high-effect genetic risk factors of potential clinical relevance, particularly in isolated populations.

We show that the present day distribution of alleles is a function of both ancient migration and very recent population movements. We reveal novel phenotype-genotype associations, including several replicated associations with height and BMI, an association between maternal age and EMB, and between twin pregnancy and NRG1. Finally, we identify a unique pattern of circulating viral DNA in plasma with high prevalence of hepatitis B and other clinically relevant maternal infections. A GWAS for viral infections identifies an exceptionally strong association between integrated herpesvirus 6 and MOV10L1, which affects piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) processing and PIWI protein function. These findings demonstrate the great value and potential of accumulating NIPT data for worldwide medical and genetic analyses. Large-scale analysis of genome sequences from non-invasive prenatal testing in Chinese women yields insights into phenotypic trait associations, viral infection patterns, and population history. "

  abstract: "We here present two methods for inferring population structure and admixture proportions in low-depth next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Inference of population structure is essential in both population genetics and association studies, and is often performed using principal component analysis (PCA) or clustering-based approaches. NGS methods provide large amounts of genetic data but are associated with statistical uncertainty, especially for low-depth sequencing data. Models can account for this uncertainty by working directly on genotype likelihoods of the unobserved genotypes. We propose a method for inferring population structure through PCA in an iterative heuristic approach of estimating individual allele frequencies, where we demonstrate improved accuracy in samples with low and variable sequencing depth for both simulated and real datasets. We also use the estimated individual allele frequencies in a fast non-negative matrix factorization method to estimate admixture proportions.

Compared to 46 published ancient- and modern-horse genomes, our data indicate that Przewalski's horses are the feral descendants of horses herded at Botai and not truly wild horses. All domestic horses dated from ~4000 years ago to present only show ~2.7% of Botai-related ancestry. This indicates that a massive genomic turnover underpins the expansion of the horse stock that gave rise to modern domesticates, which coincides with large-scale human population expansions during the Early Bronze Age.

  abstract: "The plains zebra (Equus quagga) is an ecologically important species of the African savannah. It is also one of the most numerous and widely distributed ungulates, and six subspecies have been described based on morphological variation. However, the within-species evolutionary processes have been difficult to resolve due to its high mobility and a lack of consensus regarding the population structure. We obtained genome-wide DNA polymorphism data from more than 167,000 loci for 59 plains zebras from across the species range, encompassing all recognized extant subspecies, as well as three mountain zebras (Equus zebra) and three Grevy's zebras (Equus grevyi). Surprisingly, the population genetic structure does not mirror the morphology-based subspecies delineation, underlining the dangers of basing management units exclusively on morphological variation. We use demographic modelling to provide insights into the past phylogeography of the species. The results identify a southern African location as the most likely source region from which all extant populations expanded around 370,000 years ago. We show evidence for inclusion of the extinct and phenotypically divergent quagga (Equus quagga quagga) in the plains zebra variation and reveal that it was less divergent from the other subspecies than the northernmost (Ugandan) extant population.

  abstract: "We previously showed that a common genetic variant leads to a remarkably increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the small and historically isolated Greenlandic population. Motivated by this, we aimed at discovering novel genetic determinants for glycated hemoglobin (HbA                             1C                             ) and at estimating the effect of known HbA                             1C                             -associated loci in the Greenlandic population. We analyzed genotype data from 4049 Greenlanders generated using the Illumina Cardio-Metabochip. We performed the discovery association analysis by an additive linear mixed model. To estimate the effect of known HbA                             1C                             -associated loci, we modeled the effect in the European and Inuit ancestry proportions of the Greenlandic genome (EAPGG and IAPGG, respectively). After correcting for multiple testing, we found no novel significant associations. When we investigated loci known to associate with HbA                             1C                              levels, we found that the lead variant in the GCK locus associated significantly with HbA                             1C                              levels in the IAPGG (P                             IAPGG                              = 4.8 × 10                             -6                             ,β                             IAPGG                              = 0.13SD} P I A P G G = 4.8 × 1 0 - 6, β I A P G G = 0.13 SD). Furthermore, for 10 of 15 known HbA                             1C                              loci, the effects in IAPGG were similar to the previously reported effects. Interestingly, the ANK1 locus showed a statistically significant ancestral population differential effect, with opposing directions of effect in the two ancestral populations. In conclusion, we found only 1 of the 15 known HbA                             1C                              loci to be significantly associated with HbA                             1C                              levels in the IAPGG and that two-thirds of the loci showed similar effects in Inuit as previously found in European and East Asian populations. Our results shed light on the genetic effects across ethnicities.                          "

We start by briefly explaining what genetic architecture is and why studies of isolated populations in general are valuable if we want a complete picture of the genetic architecture of diseases and other traits among humans. Then we contrast what is known about the genetic architecture of obesity and related metabolic traits among large outbred populations, like Europeans, with results from recent studies of isolated populations. Finally, we briefly discuss the perspectives of studying isolated populations to gain insight into genetic architecture in humans. "

Here, we report that selection in the region with the second most extreme signal of positive selection in Greenlandic Inuit favored a deeply divergent haplotype that is closely related to the sequence in the Denisovan genome, and was likely introgressed from an archaic population. The region contains two genes, WARS2 and TBX15, and has previously been associated with adipose tissue differentiation and body-fat distribution in humans. We show that the adaptively introgressed allele has been under selection in a much larger geographic region than just Greenland. Furthermore, it is associated with changes in expression of WARS2 and TBX15 in multiple tissues including the adrenal gland and subcutaneous adipose tissue, and with regional DNA methylation changes in TBX15.

  abstract: "Background: Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A and 2B are caused by REarranged during Transfection (RET) germline mutations. In a recent nationwide study, an unusually high prevalence (33%) of families with the C611Y mutation was reported, and it was hypothesized that this might be due to a founder effect. The first nationwide study of haplotypes in MEN2A families was conducted, with the aim of investigating the relatedness and occurrence of de novo mutations among Danish families carrying similar mutations. Methods: The study included 21 apparently unrelated MEN2A families identified from a nationwide Danish RET cohort from 1994 to 2014. Twelve, two, two, three, and two families carried the C611Y, C618F, C618Y, C620R, and C634R mutations, respectively. Single nucleotide polymorphism chip data and identity by descent analysis were used to assess relatedness. Results: A common founder mutation was found among all 12 C611Y families and between both C618Y families. No relatedness was identified in the remaining families. Conclusion: The data suggest that all families with the C611Y germline mutation in Denmark originate from a recent common ancestor, probably explaining the unusually high prevalence of this mutation. Additionally, the results indicate that the C611Y mutation rarely arises de novo, thus underlining the need for thorough multigenerational genetic work up in carriers of this mutation. "

When these wider social networks evolved among HGs is unknown. To investigate whether the contemporary HG strategy was already present in the Upper Paleolithic, we used complete genome sequences from Sunghir, a site dated to ~34,000 years before the present, containing multiple anatomically modern human individuals. We show that individuals at Sunghir derive from a population of small effective size, with limited kinship and levels of inbreeding similar to HG populations. Our findings suggest that Upper Paleolithic social organization was similar to that of living HGs, with limited relatedness within residential groups embedded in a larger mating network. "

In this study, we report the identification of 13 variants and three polymorphisms in the FLCN gene in 143 Danish patients or families with suspected BHD syndrome. Functional mini-gene splicing analysis revealed that two intronic variants (c.1062+2T>G and c.1177-5-1177-3del) introduced splicing aberrations. Eleven families exhibited the c.1062+2T>G mutation. Combined single nucleotide polymorphism array-haplotype analysis showed that these families share a 3-Mb genomic fragment containing the FLCN gene, revealing that the c.1062+2T>G mutation is a Danish founder mutation. On the basis of in silico prediction and functional splicing assays, we classify the 16 identified variants in the FLCN gene as follows: nine as pathogenic, one as likely pathogenic, three as likely benign and three as polymorphisms. In conclusion, the study describes the FLCN mutation spectrum in Danish BHD patients, and contributes to a better understanding of BHD syndrome and management of BHD patients. "

We examined the genomes of 14 early domestic horses from the Bronze and Iron Ages, dating to between ∼4.1 and 2.3 thousand years before present. We find early domestication selection patterns supporting the neural crest hypothesis, which provides a unified developmental origin for common domestic traits. Within the past 2.3 thousand years, horses lost genetic diversity and archaic DNA tracts introgressed from a now-extinct lineage. They accumulated deleterious mutations later than expected under the cost-ofdomestication hypothesis, probably because of breeding from limited numbers of stallions. We also reveal that Iron Age Scythian steppe nomads implemented breeding strategies involving no detectable inbreeding and selection for coat-color variation and robust forelimbs. Copyright "

  abstract: "The genetic consequences of population bottlenecks on patterns of deleterious genetic variation in human populations are of tremendous interest. Based on exome sequencing of 18 Greenlandic Inuit we show that the Inuit have undergone a severe ~20,000-year-long bottleneck. This has led to a markedly more extreme distribution of allele frequencies than seen for any other human population tested to date, making the Inuit the perfect population for investigating the effect of a bottleneck on patterns of deleterious variation. When comparing proxies for genetic load that assume an additive effect of deleterious alleles, the Inuit show, at most, a slight increase in load compared to European, East Asian, and African populations. Specifically, we observe <4% increase in the number of derived deleterious alleles in the Inuit. In contrast, proxies for genetic load under a recessive model suggest that the Inuit have a significantly higher load (20% increase or more) compared to other less bottlenecked human populations. Forward simulations under realistic models of demography support our empirical findings, showing up to a 6% increase in the genetic load for the Inuit population across all models of dominance. Further, the Inuit population carries fewer deleterious variants than other human populations, but those that are present tend to be at higher frequency than in other populations. Overall, our results show how recent demographic history has affected patterns of deleterious variants in human populations. "

  abstract: "The consensus approach to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been to assign equal prior probability of association to all sequence variants tested. However, some sequence variants, such as loss-of-function and missense variants, are more likely than others to affect protein function and are therefore more likely to be causative. Using data from whole-genome sequencing of 2,636 Icelanders and the association results for 96 quantitative and 123 binary phenotypes, we estimated the enrichment of association signals by sequence annotation. We propose a weighted Bonferroni adjustment that controls for the family-wise error rate (FWER), using as weights the enrichment of sequence annotations among association signals. We show that this weighted adjustment increases the power to detect association over the standard Bonferroni correction. We use the enrichment of associations by sequence annotation we have estimated in Iceland to derive significance thresholds for other populations with different numbers and combinations of sequence variants.

Improving the understanding of the underlying mechanisms and ultimately improving the treatment strategies are, thus, of great interest. To achieve this, identification of genetic variation predisposing to T2D is important. A large number of variants have been identified in large outbred populations, mainly from Europe and Asia. However, to elucidate additional variation, isolated populations have a number of advantageous properties, including increased amounts of linkage disequilibrium, and increased probability for presence of high frequency disease-associated variants due to genetic drift. Collectively, this increases the statistical power to detect association signals in isolated populations compared to large outbred populations. In this review, we elaborate on why isolated populations are a powerful resource for the identification of complex disease variants and describe their contributions to the understanding of the genetics of T2D.

  abstract: "Fatty acids (FAs) are involved in cellular processes important for normal body function, and perturbation of FA balance has been linked to metabolic disturbances, including type 2 diabetes. An individual’s level of FAs is affected by diet, lifestyle, and genetic variation. We aimed to improve the understanding of the mechanisms and pathways involved in regulation of FA tissue levels, by identifying genetic loci associated with inter-individual differences in erythrocyte membrane FA levels. We assessed the levels of 22 FAs in the phospholipid fraction of erythrocyte membranes from 2,626 Greenlanders in relation to single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped on the MetaboChip or imputed. We identified six independent association signals. Novel loci were identified on chromosomes 5 and 11 showing strongest association with oleic acid (rs76430747 in ACSL6, beta (SE): -0.386% (0.034), p = 1.8x10-28) and docosahexaenoic acid (rs6035106 in DTD1, 0.137% (0.025), p = 6.4x10-8), respectively. For a missense variant (rs80356779) in CPT1A, we identified a number of novel FA associations, the strongest with 11-eicosenoic acid (0.473% (0.035), p = 2.6x10-38), and for variants in FADS2 (rs174570), LPCAT3 (rs2110073), and CERS4 (rs11881630) we replicated known FA associations. Moreover, we observed metabolic implications of the ACSL6 (rs76430747) and CPT1A (rs80356779) variants, which both were associated with altered HbA1c (0.051% (0.013), p = 5.6x10-6 and -0.034% (0.016), p = 3.1x10-4, respectively). The latter variant was also associated with reduced insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, -0.193 (0.050), p = 3.8x10-6), as well as measures of smaller body size, including weight (-2.676 kg (0.523), p = 2.4x10-7), lean mass (-1.200 kg (0.271), p = 1.7x10-6), height (-0.966 cm (0.230), p = 2.0x10-5), and BMI (-0.638 kg/m2 (0.181), p = 2.8x10-4). In conclusion, we have identified novel genetic determinants of FA composition in phospholipids in erythrocyte membranes, and have shown examples of links between genetic variants associated with altered FA membrane levels and changes in metabolic traits.

However, when dealing with non-model organisms it is not always easy to choose the best approach given a specific biological question, a limited budget, and challenging sample material. Furthermore, although recent advances in technology offer unprecedented opportunities for research in non-model organisms, they also demand unprecedented awareness from the researcher regarding the assumptions and limitations of each method. In this review we present an overview of the current sequencing technologies and the methods used in typical high-throughput data analysis pipelines. Subsequently, we contextualize high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies within their applications in non-model organism biology. We include tips regarding managing unconventional sample material, comparative and population genetic approaches that do not require fully assembled genomes, and advice on how to deal with low depth sequencing data.

  abstract: "The population history of Aboriginal Australians remains largely uncharacterized. Here we generate high-coverage genomes for 83 Aboriginal Australians (speakers of Pama-Nyungan languages) and 25 Papuans from the New Guinea Highlands. We find that Papuan and Aboriginal Australian ancestors diversified 25-40 thousand years ago (kya), suggesting pre-Holocene population structure in the ancient continent of Sahul (Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania). However, all of the studied Aboriginal Australians descend from a single founding population that differentiated ∼10-32 kya. We infer a population expansion in northeast Australia during the Holocene epoch (past 10,000 years) associated with limited gene flow from this region to the rest of Australia, consistent with the spread of the Pama-Nyungan languages. We estimate that Aboriginal Australians and Papuans diverged from Eurasians 51-72 kya, following a single out-of-Africa dispersal, and subsequently admixed with archaic populations. Finally, we report evidence of selection in Aboriginal Australians potentially associated with living in the desert. "

However, studies of T2D in population isolates are gaining attention as they provide several advantages over open populations in genetic disease studies, including increased linkage disequilibrium, homogeneous environmental exposure, and increased allele frequency. We recently performed a study in the small, historically isolated Greenlandic population, in which the prevalence of T2D has increased to more than 10%. In this study, we identified a common nonsense variant in TBC1D4, which has a population-wide impact on glucose-stimulated plasma glucose, serum insulin levels, and T2D. The variant defines a specific subtype of non-autoimmune diabetes characterized by decreased post-prandial glucose uptake and muscular insulin resistance. These and other recent findings in population isolates illustrate the value of performing medical genetic studies in genetically isolated populations. In this review, we describe some of the advantages of performing genetic studies of T2D and related cardio-metabolic traits in a population isolate like the Greenlandic, and we discuss potentials and perspectives for future research into T2D in this population.

  abstract: "Przewalski's horses (PHs, Equus ferus ssp. przewalskii) were discovered in the Asian steppes in the 1870s and represent the last remaining true wild horses. PHs became extinct in the wild in the 1960s but survived in captivity, thanks to major conservation efforts. The current population is still endangered, with just 2,109 individuals, one-quarter of which are in Chinese and Mongolian reintroduction reserves [1]. These horses descend from a founding population of 12 wild-caught PHs and possibly up to four domesticated individuals [2-4]. With a stocky build, an erect mane, and stripped and short legs, they are phenotypically and behaviorally distinct from domesticated horses (DHs, Equus caballus). Here, we sequenced the complete genomes of 11 PHs, representing all founding lineages, and five historical specimens dated to 1878-1929 CE, including the Holotype. These were compared to the hitherto-most-extensive genome dataset characterized for horses, comprising 21 new genomes. We found that loci showing the most genetic differentiation with DHs were enriched in genes involved in metabolism, cardiac disorders, muscle contraction, reproduction, behavior, and signaling pathways. We also show that DH and PH populations split ∼45,000 years ago and have remained connected by gene-flow thereafter. Finally, we monitor the genomic impact of ∼110 years of captivity, revealing reduced heterozygosity, increased inbreeding, and variable introgression of domestic alleles, ranging from non-detectable to as much as 31.1%. This, together with the identification of ancestry informative markers and corrections to the International Studbook, establishes a framework for evaluating the persistence of genetic variation in future reintroduced populations.

  abstract: "Usher syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital hearing impairment, progressive visual loss owing to retinitis pigmentosa and in some cases vestibular dysfunction. Usher syndrome is divided into three subtypes, USH1, USH2 and USH3. Twelve loci and eleven genes have so far been identified. Duplications and deletions in PCDH15 and USH2A that lead to USH1 and USH2, respectively, have previously been identified in patients from United Kingdom, Spain and Italy. In this study, we investigate the proportion of exon deletions and duplications in PCDH15 and USH2A in 20 USH1 and 30 USH2 patients from Denmark using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Two heterozygous deletions were identified in USH2A, but no deletions or duplications were identified in PCDH15. Next-generation mate-pair sequencing was used to identify the exact breakpoints of the two deletions identified in USH2A. Our results suggest that USH2 is caused by USH2A exon deletions in a small fraction of the patients, whereas deletions or duplications in PCDH15 might be rare in Danish Usher patients. "

  abstract: "Because of past limitations in samples and genotyping technologies, important questions about the history of the present-day Greenlandic population remain unanswered. In an effort to answer these questions and in general investigate the genetic history of the Greenlandic population, we analyzed ∼200,000 SNPs from more than 10% of the adult Greenlandic population (n = 4,674). We found that recent gene flow from Europe has had a substantial impact on the population: more than 80% of the Greenlanders have some European ancestry (on average ∼25% of their genome). However, we also found that the amount of recent European gene flow varies across Greenland and is far smaller in the more historically isolated areas in the north and east and in the small villages in the south. Furthermore, we found that there is substantial population structure in the Inuit genetic component of the Greenlanders and that individuals from the east, west, and north can be distinguished from each other. Moreover, the genetic differences in the Inuit ancestry are consistent with a single colonization wave of the island from north to west to south to east. Although it has been speculated that there has been historical admixture between the Norse Vikings who lived in Greenland for a limited period ∼600-1,000 years ago and the Inuit, we found no evidence supporting this hypothesis. Similarly, we found no evidence supporting a previously hypothesized admixture event between the Inuit in East Greenland and the Dorset people, who lived in Greenland before the Inuit. "

  abstract: "Yakutia, Sakha Republic, in the Siberian Far East, represents one of the coldest places on Earth, with winter record temperatures dropping below-70 °C. Nevertheless, Yakutian horses survive all year round in the open air due to striking phenotypic adaptations, including compact body conformations, extremely hairy winter coats, and acute seasonal differences in metabolic activities. The evolutionary origins of Yakutian horses and the genetic basis of their adaptations remain, however, contentious. Here, we present the complete genomes of nine present-day Yakutian horses and two ancient specimens dating from the early 19th century and ∼5,200 y ago. By comparing these genomes with the genomes of two Late Pleistocene, 27 domesticated, and three wild Przewalski's horses, we find that contemporary Yakutian horses do not descend from the native horses that populated the region until the mid-Holocene, but were most likely introduced following the migration of the Yakut people a few centuries ago. Thus, they represent one of the fastest cases of adaptation to the extreme temperatures of the Arctic. We find cisregulatorymutations to have contributed more than nonsynonymous changes to their adaptation, likely due to the comparatively limited standing variation within gene bodies at the time the population was founded. Genes involved in hair development, body size, and metabolic and hormone signaling pathways represent an essential part of the Yakutian horse adaptive genetic toolkit. Finally, we find evidence for convergent evolution with native human populations and woolly mammoths, suggesting that only a few evolutionary strategies are compatible with survival in extremely cold environments."

  abstract: "Kennewick Man, referred to as the Ancient One by Native Americans, is a male human skeleton discovered in Washington state (USA) in 1996 and initially radiocarbon dated to 8,340-9,200 calibrated years before present (bp). His population affinities have been the subject of scientific debate and legal controversy. Based on an initial study of cranial morphology it was asserted that Kennewick Man was neither Native American nor closely related to the claimant Plateau tribes of the Pacific Northwest, who claimed ancestral relationship and requested repatriation under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The morphological analysis was important to judicial decisions that Kennewick Man was not Native American and that therefore NAGPRA did not apply. Instead of repatriation, additional studies of the remains were permitted. Subsequent craniometric analysis affirmed Kennewick Man to be more closely related to circumpacific groups such as the Ainu and Polynesians than he is to modern Native Americans. In order to resolve Kennewick Man's ancestry and affiliations, we have sequenced his genome to ∼1 × coverage and compared it to worldwide genomic data including for the Ainu and Polynesians. We find that Kennewick Man is closer to modern Native Americans than to any other population worldwide. Among the Native American groups for whom genome-wide data are available for comparison, several seem to be descended from a population closely related to that of Kennewick Man, including the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation (Colville), one of the five tribes claiming Kennewick Man. We revisit the cranial analyses and find that, as opposed to genome-wide comparisons, it is not possible on that basis to affiliate Kennewick Man to specific contemporary groups. We therefore conclude based on genetic comparisons that Kennewick Man shows continuity with Native North Americans over at least the last eight millennia. "

Furthermore, the genetics of adaptation to the new environmental and cultural context of the Southwest is largely uncharacterized 7. To address these issues, we compared nuclear DNA from 32 archaeological maize samples spanning 6,000 years of evolution to modern landraces. We found that the initial diffusion of maize into the Southwest about 4,000 years ago is likely to have occurred along a highland route, followed by gene flow from a lowland coastal maize beginning at least 2,000 years ago. Our population genetic analysis also enabled us to differentiate selection during domestication for adaptation to the climatic and cultural environment of the Southwest, identifying adaptation loci relevant to drought tolerance and sugar content.

  abstract: "The indigenous people of Greenland, the Inuit, have lived for a long time in the extreme conditions of the Arctic, including low annual temperatures, and with a specialized diet rich in protein and fatty acids, particularly omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). A scan of Inuit genomes for signatures of adaptation revealed signals at several loci, with the strongest signal located in a cluster of fatty acid desaturases that determine PUFA levels. The selected alleles are associated with multiple metabolic and anthropometric phenotypes and have large effect sizes for weight and height, with the effect on height replicated in Europeans. By analyzing membrane lipids, we found that the selected alleles modulate fatty acid composition, which may affect the regulation of growth hormones. Thus, the Inuit have genetic and physiological adaptations to a diet rich in PUFAs."

We show that Paleo-Eskimos (∼3000 BCE to 1300 CE) represent a migration pulse into the Americas independent of both Native American and Inuit expansions. Furthermore, the genetic continuity characterizing the Paleo-Eskimo period was interrupted by the arrival of a new population, representing the ancestors of present-day Inuit, with evidence of past gene flow between these lineages. Despite periodic abandonment of major Arctic regions, a single Paleo-Eskimo metapopulation likely survived in near-isolation for more than 4000 years, only to vanish around 700 years ago."

  abstract: "Horses, asses, and zebras belong to a single genus, Equus, which emerged 4.0-4.5 Mya. Although the equine fossil record represents a textbook example of evolution, the succession of events that gave rise to the diversity of species existing today remains unclear. Here we present six genomes from each living species of asses and zebras. This completes the set of genomes available for all extant species in the genus, which was hitherto represented only by the horse and the domestic donkey. In addition, we used a museum specimen to characterize the genome of the quagga zebra, which was driven to extinction in the early 1900s. We scan the genomes for lineage-specific adaptations and identify 48 genes that have evolved under positive selection and are involved in olfaction, immune response, development, locomotion, and behavior. Our extensive genome dataset reveals a highly dynamic demographic history with synchronous expansions and collapses on different continents during the last 400 ky after major climatic events. We show that the earliest speciation occurred with gene flow in Northern America, and that the ancestor of present-day asses and zebras dispersed into the Old World 2.1-3.4 Mya. Strikingly, we also find evidence for gene flow involving three contemporary equine species despite chromosomal numbers varying from 16 pairs to 31 pairs. These findings challenge the claim that the accumulation of chromosomal rearrangements drive complete reproductive isolation, and promote equids as a fundamental model for understanding the interplay between chromosomal structure, gene flow, and, ultimately, speciation.

  abstract: "The origins of the First Americans remain contentious. Although Native Americans seem to be genetically most closely related to east Asians, there is no consensus with regard to which specific Old World populations they are closest to. Here we sequence the draft genome of an approximately 24,000-year-old individual (MA-1), from Mal'ta in south-central Siberia, to an average depth of 1×. To our knowledge this is the oldest anatomically modern human genome reported to date. The MA-1 mitochondrial genome belongs to haplogroup U, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers, and the Y chromosome of MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and near the root of most Native American lineages. Similarly, we find autosomal evidence that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians. This suggests that populations related to contemporary western Eurasians had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought. Furthermore, we estimate that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through gene flow from this ancient population. This is likely to have occurred after the divergence of Native American ancestors from east Asian ancestors, but before the diversification of Native American populations in the New World. Gene flow from the MA-1 lineage into Native American ancestors could explain why several crania from the First Americans have been reported as bearing morphological characteristics that do not resemble those of east Asians. Sequencing of another south-central Siberian, Afontova Gora-2 dating to approximately 17,000 years ago, revealed similar autosomal genetic signatures as MA-1, suggesting that the region was continuously occupied by humans throughout the Last Glacial Maximum. Our findings reveal that western Eurasian genetic signatures in modern-day Native Americans derive not only from post-Columbian admixture, as commonly thought, but also from a mixed ancestry of the First Americans.

  abstract: "Background: Evidence is accumulating supporting a beneficial effect of vitamin D in multiple sclerosis (MS). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown significant associations between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in key genes in the vitamin D metabolism. Objective: To examine the association between 25(OH)D and six GWAS SNPs and environmental factors in 1497 MS patients. Methods: Blood samples and lifestyle questionnaires were collected between 2009 and 2012. Genotyping of GC-, CYP2R1- and NADSYN1-SNPs was performed by TaqMan allelic discrimination (Life Technologies). Results: We found significant associations between 25(OH)D and SNPs in GC (rs7041, p = 0.01 and rs2282679, p = 0.03) and CYP2R1 (rs10741657, p =1.8 × 10-4).

Conclusion: In this cross-sectional study, we found significant effects of environmental factors and SNPs in GC and CYP2R1 on 25(OH)D in MS patients. Since 25(OH)D might have protective effects in MS, and vitamin D supply is a modifiable factor, it may be important to include this in the MS treatment regimen. "

  abstract: "In this paper, we mine full mtDNA sequences from an exome capture data set of 2000 Danes, showing that it is possible to get high-quality full-genome sequences of the mitochondrion from this resource. The sample includes 1000 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 1000 controls. We characterise the variation found in the mtDNA sequence in Danes and relate the variation to diabetes risk as well as to several blood phenotypes of the controls but find no significant associations. We report 2025 polymorphisms, of which 393 have not been reported previously. These 393 mutations are both very rare and estimated to be caused by very recent mutations but individuals with type 2 diabetes do not possess more of these variants. Population genetics analysis using Bayesian skyline plot shows a recent history of rapid population growth in the Danish population in accordance with the fact that >40% of variable sites are observed as singletons.

  abstract: "Clovis, with its distinctive biface, blade and osseous technologies, is the oldest widespread archaeological complex defined in North America, dating from 11,100 to 10,700 14 C years before present (bp) (13,000 to 12,600 calendar years bp). Nearly 50 years of archaeological research point to the Clovis complex as having developed south of the North American ice sheets from an ancestral technology. However, both the origins and the genetic legacy of the people who manufactured Clovis tools remain under debate. It is generally believed that these people ultimately derived from Asia and were directly related to contemporary Native Americans. An alternative, Solutrean, hypothesis posits that the Clovis predecessors emigrated from southwestern Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum. Here we report the genome sequence of a male infant (Anzick-1) recovered from the Anzick burial site in western Montana. The human bones date to 10,705 ± 35 14 C years bp (approximately 12,707-12,556 calendar years bp) and were directly associated with Clovis tools. We sequenced the genome to an average depth of 14.4× and show that the gene flow from the Siberian Upper Palaeolithic Mal'ta population into Native American ancestors is also shared by the Anzick-1 individual and thus happened before 12,600 years bp. We also show that the Anzick-1 individual is more closely related to all indigenous American populations than to any other group. Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that Anzick-1 belonged to a population directly ancestral to many contemporary Native Americans. Finally, we find evidence of a deep divergence in Native American populations that predates the Anzick-1 individual. "

  abstract: "TheGreenlandic population, a small and historically isolated founder population comprising about 57,000 inhabitants, has experienced a dramatic increase in type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence during the past 25 years 1.Motivated by this,we performedassociationmapping ofT2Drelated quantitative traits in up to 2,575 Greenlandic individuals without knowndiabetes. Using array-based genotyping and exome sequencing, we discovered a nonsense p.Arg684Ter variant (in which arginine is replaced by a termination codon) in the geneTBC1D4 with an allele frequency of 17%.Herewe show that homozygous carriers of this variant havemarkedlyhigherconcentrationsofplasmaglucose(β53.8mmol l-1, P 52.5310-35) and serum insulin (β5165pmoll-1,P51. 5310-20) 2 hours after an oral glucose load compared with individuals with other genotypes (both non-carriers and heterozygous carriers). Furthermore, homozygous carriers have marginally lower concentrations of fasting plasma glucose (β520.18 mmoll-1,P51.1310-6) andfasting serum insulin (β528.3pmoll-1, P50.0014), and their T2D risk is markedly increased (odds ratio (OR)510.3,P 51.6310-24). Heterozygous carriers have amoderately higher plasmaglucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose load than non-carriers (β50.43 mmoll -1,P 5 5.3310-5). Analyses of skeletal muscle biopsies showed lower messenger RNA and protein levels of the long isoform of TBC1D4, and lower muscle protein levels of the glucose transporter GLUT4, with increasing number of p.Arg684Ter alleles. These findings are concomitant with a severely decreased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake inmuscle, leading to postprandial hyperglycaemia, impaired glucose tolerance and T2D. The observed effect sizes are several times larger than any previous findings in large-scale genome-wide association studies of these traits2-4 and constitute further proof of the value of conducting genetic association studies outside the traditional setting of large homogeneous populations.

  abstract: "Background:Cytokine response plays a vital role in various human lipopolysaccharide (LPS) infectious and inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to find genetic variants that might affect the levels of LPS-induced interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1ra and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α cytokine production.Methods:We performed an initial genome-wide association study using Affymetrix Human Mapping 500 K GeneChip® to screen 130 healthy individuals of Danish descent. The levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1ra and TNF-α in 24-hour LPS-stimulated whole blood samples were compared within different genotypes. The 152 most significant SNPs were replicated using Illumina Golden Gate® GeneChip in an independent cohort of 186 Danish individuals. Next, 9 of the most statistical significant SNPs were replicated using PCR-based genotyping in an independent cohort of 400 Danish individuals. All results were analyzed in a combined study among the 716 Danish individuals.Results:Only one marker of the 500 K Gene Chip in the discovery study showed a significant association with LPS-induced IL-1ra cytokine levels after Bonferroni correction (P<10-7). However, this SNP was not associated with the IL-1ra cytokine levels in the replication dataset. No SNPs reached genome-wide significance for the five cytokine levels in the combined analysis of all three stages.Conclusions:The associations between the genetic variants and the LPS-induced IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1ra and TNF-α cytokine levels were not significant in the meta-analysis. This present study does not support a strong genetic effect of LPS-stimulated cytokine production; however, the potential for type II errors should be considered. "

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: Human complex metabolic traits are in part regulated by genetic determinants. Here we applied exome sequencing to identify novel associations of coding polymorphisms at minor allele frequencies (MAFs) >1% with common metabolic phenotypes. Methods: The study comprised three stages. We performed medium-depth (8×) whole exome sequencing in 1,000 cases with type 2 diabetes, BMI >27.5 kg/m2 and hypertension and in 1,000 controls (stage 1). We selected 16,192 polymorphisms nominally associated (p < 0.05) with case-control status, from four selected annotation categories or from loci reported to associate with metabolic traits. These variants were genotyped in 15,989 Danes to search for association with 12 metabolic phenotypes (stage 2). In stage 3, polymorphisms showing potential associations were genotyped in a further 63,896 Europeans. Results: Exome sequencing identified 70,182 polymorphisms with MAF >1%. In stage 2 we identified 51 potential associations with one or more of eight metabolic phenotypes covered by 45 unique polymorphisms. In meta-analyses of stage 2 and stage 3 results, we demonstrated robust associations for coding polymorphisms in CD300LG (fasting HDL-cholesterol: MAF 3.5%, p = 8.5 × 10-14), COBLL1 (type 2 diabetes: MAF 12.5%, OR 0.88, p = 1.2 × 10-11) and MACF1 (type 2 diabetes: MAF 23.4%, OR 1.10, p = 8.2 × 10-10). Conclusions/interpretation: We applied exome sequencing as a basis for finding genetic determinants of metabolic traits and show the existence of low-frequency and common coding polymorphisms with impact on common metabolic traits. Based on our study, coding polymorphisms with MAF above 1% do not seem to have particularly high effect sizes on the measured metabolic traits. "

  abstract: "Most methods for next-generation sequencing (NGS) data analyses incorporate information regarding allele frequencies using the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) as a prior. However, many organisms including those that are domesticated, partially selfing, or with asexual life cycles show strong deviations from HWE. For such species, and specially for low-coverage data, it is necessary to obtain estimates of inbreeding coefficients (F ) for each individual before calling genotypes. Here, we present two methods for estimating inbreeding coefficients from NGS data based on an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. We assess the impact of taking inbreeding into account when calling genotypes or estimating the site frequency spectrum (SFS), and demonstrate a marked increase in accuracy on low-coverage highly inbred samples. We demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of these methods in both simulated and real data sets. "

  abstract: "The rich fossil record of equids has made them a model for evolutionary processes. Here we present a 1.12-times coverage draft genome from a horse bone recovered from permafrost dated to approximately 560-780 thousand years before present (kyr bp). Our data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined so far by almost an order of magnitude. For comparison, we sequenced the genome of a Late Pleistocene horse (43 kyr bp), and modern genomes of five domestic horse breeds (Equus ferus caballus), a Przewalski's horse (E. f. przewalskii) and a donkey (E. asinus). Our analyses suggest that the Equus lineage giving rise to all contemporary horses, zebras and donkeys originated 4.0-4.5 million years before present (Myr bp), twice the conventionally accepted time to the most recent common ancestor of the genus Equus. We also find that horse population size fluctuated multiple times over the past 2 Myr, particularly during periods of severe climatic changes. We estimate that the Przewalski's and domestic horse populations diverged 38-72 kyr bp, and find no evidence of recent admixture between the domestic horse breeds and the Przewalski's horse investigated. This supports the contention that Przewalski's horses represent the last surviving wild horse population. We find similar levels of genetic variation among Przewalski's and domestic populations, indicating that the former are genetically viable and worthy of conservation efforts. We also find evidence for continuous selection on the immune system and olfaction throughout horse evolution. Finally, we identify 29 genomic regions among horse breeds that deviate from neutrality and show low levels of genetic variation compared to the Przewalski's horse. Such regions could correspond to loci selected early during domestication. "

  abstract: "Background: A number of different statistics are used for detecting natural selection using DNA sequencing data, including statistics that are summaries of the frequency spectrum, such as Tajima's D. These statistics are now often being applied in the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. However, estimates of frequency spectra from NGS data are strongly affected by low sequencing coverage; the inherent technology dependent variation in sequencing depth causes systematic differences in the value of the statistic among genomic regions.Results: We have developed an approach that accommodates the uncertainty of the data when calculating site frequency based neutrality test statistics. A salient feature of this approach is that it implicitly solves the problems of varying sequencing depth, missing data and avoids the need to infer variable sites for the analysis and thereby avoids ascertainment problems introduced by a SNP discovery process.Conclusion: Using an empirical Bayes approach for fast computations, we show that this method produces results for low-coverage NGS data comparable to those achieved when the genotypes are known without uncertainty. We also validate the method in an analysis of data from the 1000 genomes project. The method is implemented in a fast framework which enables researchers to perform these neutrality tests on a genome-wide scale. "

  abstract: "It has been hypothesized that, in aggregate, rare variants in coding regions of genes explain a substantial fraction of the heritability of common diseases. We sequenced the exomes of 1,000 Danish cases with common forms of type 2 diabetes (including body mass index > 27.5 kg/m2 and hypertension) and 1,000 healthy controls to an average depth of 56×. Our simulations suggest that our study had the statistical power to detect at least one causal gene (a gene containing causal mutations) if the heritability of these common diseases was explained by rare variants in the coding regions of a limited number of genes. We applied a series of gene-based tests to detect such susceptibility genes. However, no gene showed a significant association with disease risk after we corrected for the number of genes analyzed. Thus, we could reject a model for the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes where rare nonsynonymous variants clustered in a modest number of genes (fewer than 20) are responsible for the majority of disease risk.

  abstract: "Genome-wide association studies have mainly relied on common HapMap sequence variations. Recently, sequencing approaches have allowed analysis of low frequency and rare variants in conjunction with common variants, thereby improving the search for functional variants and thus the understanding of the underlying biology of human traits and diseases. Here, we used a large Icelandic whole genome sequence dataset combined with Danish exome sequence data to gain insight into the genetic architecture of serum levels of vitamin B12 (B12) and folate. Up to 22.9 million sequence variants were analyzed in combined samples of 45,576 and 37,341 individuals with serum B12 and folate measurements, respectively. We found six novel loci associating with serum B12 (CD320, TCN2, ABCD4, MMAA, MMACHC) or folate levels (FOLR3) and confirmed seven loci for these traits (TCN1, FUT6, FUT2, CUBN, CLYBL, MUT, MTHFR). Conditional analyses established that four loci contain additional independent signals. Interestingly, 13 of the 18 identified variants were coding and 11 of the 13 target genes have known functions related to B12 and folate pathways. Contrary to epidemiological studies we did not find consistent association of the variants with cardiovascular diseases, cancers or Alzheimer's disease although some variants demonstrated pleiotropic effects. Although to some degree impeded by low statistical power for some of these conditions, these data suggest that sequence variants that contribute to the population diversity in serum B12 or folate levels do not modify the risk of developing these conditions. Yet, the study demonstrates the value of combining whole genome and exome sequencing approaches to ascertain the genetic and molecular architectures underlying quantitative trait associations. "

  abstract: "Over the past few years, new high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have dramatically increased speed and reduced sequencing costs. However, the use of these sequencing technologies is often challenged by errors and biases associated with the bioinformatical methods used for analyzing the data. In particular, the use of naïve methods to identify polymorphic sites and infer genotypes can inflate downstream analyses. Recently, explicit modeling of genotype probability distributions has been proposed as a method for taking genotype call uncertainty into account. Based on this idea, we propose a novel method for quantifying population genetic differentiation from next-generation sequencing data. In addition, we present a strategy for investigating population structure via principal components analysis. Through extensive simulations, we compare the new method herein proposed to approaches based on genotype calling and demonstrate a marked improvement in estimation accuracy for a wide range of conditions. We apply the method to a large-scale genomic data set of domesticated and wild silkworms sequenced at low coverage. We find that we can infer the fine-scale genetic structure of the sampled individuals, suggesting that employing this new method is useful for investigating the genetic relationships of populations sampled at low coverage.

With next generation sequencing technologies it is possible to obtain genetic data for all accessible genetic variations in the genome. Existing methods for admixture analysis rely on known genotypes. However, individual genotypes cannot be inferred from low-depth sequencing data without introducing errors. This article presents a new method for inferring an individual's ancestry that takes the uncertainty introduced in next generation sequencing data into account. This is achieved by working directly with genotype likelihoods that contain all relevant information of the unobserved genotypes. Using simulations as well as publicly available sequencing data, we demonstrate that the presented method has great accuracy even for very low-depth data. At the same time, we demonstrate that applying existing methods to genotypes called from the same data can introduce severe biases.

  abstract: "The advances in sequencing technology have made large-scale sequencing studies for large cohorts feasible. Often, the primary goal for large-scale studies is to identify genetic variants associated with a disease or other phenotypes. Even when deep sequencing is performed, there will be many sites where there is not enough data to call genotypes accurately. Ignoring the genotype classification uncertainty by basing subsequent analyses on called genotypes leads to a loss in power. Additionally, using called genotypes can lead to spurious association signals. Some methods taking the uncertainty of genotype calls into account have been proposed; most require numerical optimization which for large-scale data is not always computationally feasible. We show that using a score statistic for the joint likelihood of observed phenotypes and observed sequencing data provides an attractive approach to association testing for next-generation sequencing data. The joint model accounts for the genotype classification uncertainty via the posterior probabilities of the genotypes given the observed sequencing data, which gives the approach higher power than methods based on called genotypes. This strategy remains computationally feasible due to the use of score statistics. As part of the joint likelihood, we model the distribution of the phenotypes using a generalized linear model framework, which works for both quantitative and discrete phenotypes. Thus, the method presented here is applicable to case-control studies as well as mapping of quantitative traits. The model allows additional covariates that enable correction for confounding factors such as population stratification or cohort effects. "

  abstract: "A major question in evolutionary biology is how natural selection has shaped patterns of genetic variation across the human genome. Previous work has documented a reduction in genetic diversity in regions of the genome with low recombination rates. However, it is unclear whether other summaries of genetic variation, like allele frequencies, are also correlated with recombination rate and whether these correlations can be explained solely by negative selection against deleterious mutations or whether positive selection acting on favorable alleles is also required. Here we attempt to address these questions by analyzing three different genome-wide resequencing datasets from European individuals. We document several significant correlations between different genomic features. In particular, we find that average minor allele frequency and diversity are reduced in regions of low recombination and that human diversity, human-chimp divergence, and average minor allele frequency are reduced near genes. Population genetic simulations show that either positive natural selection acting on favorable mutations or negative natural selection acting against deleterious mutations can explain these correlations. However, models with strong positive selection on nonsynonymous mutations and little negative selection predict a stronger negative correlation between neutral diversity and nonsynonymous divergence than observed in the actual data, supporting the importance of negative, rather than positive, selection throughout the genome. Further, we show that the widespread presence of weakly deleterious alleles, rather than a small number of strongly positively selected mutations, is responsible for the correlation between neutral genetic diversity and recombination rate. This work suggests that natural selection has affected multiple aspects of linked neutral variation throughout the human genome and that positive selection is not required to explain these observations.

However, IBD regions can be difficult to detect, especially in the common case where no pedigree information is available. In particular, all existing non-pedigree based methods can only infer IBD sharing between two individuals. Here, we present a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for detection of IBD regions, which does not rely on any pedigree information. It is based on a probabilistic model applicable to unphased SNP data. It can take inbreeding, allele frequencies, genotyping errors, and genomic distances into account. And most importantly, it can simultaneously infer IBD sharing among multiple individuals. Through simulations, we show that the simultaneous modeling of multiple individuals makes the method more powerful and accurate than several other non-pedigree based methods. We illustrate the potential of the method by applying it to data from individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer, and show that a known disease-causing mutation can be mapped to a 2.2-Mb region using SNP data from only five seemingly unrelated affected individuals. This would not be possible using classical linkage mapping or association mapping. "

  abstract: "We present an Aboriginal Australian genomic sequence obtained from a 100-year-old lock of hair donated by an Aboriginal man from southern Western Australia in the early 20th century. We detect no evidence of European admixture and estimate contamination levels to be below 0.5%. We show that Aboriginal Australians are descendants of an early human dispersal into eastern Asia, possibly 62,000 to 75,000 years ago. This dispersal is separate from the one that gave rise to modern Asians 25,000 to 38,000 years ago. We also find evidence of gene flow between populations of the two dispersal waves prior to the divergence of Native Americans from modern Asian ancestors. Our findings support the hypothesis that present-day Aboriginal Australians descend from the earliest humans to occupy Australia, likely representing one of the oldest continuous populations outside Africa."

  abstract: "Background: Estimation of allele frequency is of fundamental importance in population genetic analyses and in association mapping. In most studies using next-generation sequencing, a cost effective approach is to use medium or low-coverage data (e.g., < 15X). However, SNP calling and allele frequency estimation in such studies is associated with substantial statistical uncertainty because of varying coverage and high error rates.Results: We evaluate a new maximum likelihood method for estimating allele frequencies in low and medium coverage next-generation sequencing data. The method is based on integrating over uncertainty in the data for each individual rather than first calling genotypes. This method can be applied to directly test for associations in case/control studies. We use simulations to compare the likelihood method to methods based on genotype calling, and show that the likelihood method outperforms the genotype calling methods in terms of: (1) accuracy of allele frequency estimation, (2) accuracy of the estimation of the distribution of allele frequencies across neutrally evolving sites, and (3) statistical power in association mapping studies. Using real re-sequencing data from 200 individuals obtained from an exon-capture experiment, we show that the patterns observed in the simulations are also found in real data.Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that association mapping and estimation of allele frequencies should not be based on genotype calling in low to medium coverage data. Furthermore, if genotype calling methods are used, it is usually better not to filter genotypes based on the call confidence score. "

Obtained from 4,000-year-old permafrost-preserved hair, the genome represents a male individual from the first known culture to settle in Greenland. Sequenced to an average depth of 20Ã-, we recover 79% of the diploid genome, an amount close to the practical limit of current sequencing technologies. We identify 353,151 high-confidence single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 6.8% have not been reported previously. We estimate raw read contamination to be no higher than 0.8%. We use functional SNP assessment to assign possible phenotypic characteristics of the individual that belonged to a culture whose location has yielded only trace human remains. We compare the high-confidence SNPs to those of contemporary populations to find the populations most closely related to the individual. This provides evidence for a migration from Siberia into the New World some 5,500 years ago, independent of that giving rise to the modern Native Americans and Inuit. "

  abstract: "Background: The growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) is mediating hunger sensation when stimulated by its natural ligand ghrelin. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that common and rare variation in the GHSR locus are related to increased prevalence of obesity and overweight among Whites. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a population-based study sample of 15,854 unrelated, middle-aged Danes, seven variants were genotyped to capture common variation in an 11 kbp region including GHSR. These were investigated for their individual and haplotypic association with obesity. None of these analyses revealed consistent association with measures of obesity. A -151C/T promoter mutation in the GHSR was found in two unrelated obese patients. One family presented with complete co-segregation, but the other with incomplete co-segregation. The mutation resulted in an increased transcriptional activity (p<0.02) and introduction of a specific binding for Sp-1-like nuclear extracts relative to the wild type. The -151C/T mutation was genotyped in the 15,854 Danes with a minor allele frequency of 0.01%. No association with obesity in carriers (mean BMI: 27±64 kg/m2) versus non-carriers (mean BMI: 28±65 kg/m2) (p>0.05) could be shown. Conclusions/Significance: In a population-based study sample of 15,854 Danes no association between GHSR genotypes and measures of obesity and overweight was found. Also, analyses of GHSR haplotypes lack consistent associations with obesity related traits. A rare functional GHSR promoter mutation variant was identified, yet there was no consistent relationship with obesity in neither family- nor population-based studies. "

  abstract: "Chip-based high-throughput genotyping has facilitated genome-wide studies of genetic diversity. Many studies have utilized these large data sets to make inferences about the demographic history of human populations using measures of genetic differentiation such as FST or principal component analyses. However, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip data suffer from ascertainment biases caused by the SNP discovery process in which a small number of individuals from selected populations are used as discovery panels. In this study, we investigate the effect of the ascertainment bias on inferences regarding genetic differentiation among populations in one of the common genome-wide genotyping platforms. We generate SNP genotyping data for individuals that previously have been subject to partial genome-wide Sanger sequencing and compare inferences based on genotyping data to inferences based on direct sequencing. In addition, we also analyze publicly available genome-wide data. We demonstrate that the ascertainment biases will distort measures of human diversity and possibly change conclusions drawn from these measures in some times unexpected ways. We also show that details of the genotyping calling algorithms can have a surprisingly large effect on population genetic inferences. We not only present a correction of the spectrum for the widely used Affymetrix SNP chips but also show that such corrections are difficult to generalize among studies. "

We have recently identified a Greenlandic Inuit BRCA1 nucleotide 234T>G/c.115T>G (p.Cys39Gly) founder mutation, which at that time was the only disease-causing BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation identified in this population. Here, we describe the identification of a novel disease-causing BRCA1 nucleotide 4803delCC/c.4684delCC mutation in a Greenlandic Inuit with ovarian cancer.

We have also identified a BRCA1 nucleotide 249T>A/c.130T>A (p.Cys44Ser) mutation in another Greenlandic individual with ovarian cancer. This patient share a 1-2 Mb genomic fragment, containing the BRCA1 gene, with four Danish families harbouring the same mutation, suggesting that the 249T>A/c.130T>A (p.Cys44Ser) mutation originates from a Danish ancestor. We conclude that screening of Greenlandic Inuits with high risk of breast or ovarian cancer should include sequencing of the entire BRCA1 gene. "

  abstract: "There has recently been considerable interest in detecting natural selection in the human genome. Selection will usually tend to increase identity-by-descent (IBD) among individuals in a population, and many methods for detecting recent and ongoing positive selection indirectly take advantage of this. In this article we show that excess IBD sharing is a general property of natural selection and we show that this fact makes it possible to detect several types of selection including a type that is otherwise difficult to detect: selection acting on standing genetic variation. Motivated by this, we use a recently developed method for identifying IBD sharing among individuals from genome-wide data to scan populations from the new HapMap phase 3 project for regions with excess IBD sharing in order to identify regions in the human genome that have been under strong, very recent selection. The HLA region is by far the region showing the most extreme signal, suggesting that much of the strong recent selection acting on the human genome has been immune related and acting on HLA loci. As equilibrium overdominance does not tend to increase IBD, we argue that this type of selection cannot explain our observations. Copyright "

  abstract: "Interleukin-6 (IL6) is critically involved in inflammation and metabolism. About 1% of people produce IL6 autoantibodies (aAb-IL6) that impair IL6 signaling in vivo. We tested the hypothesis that the prevalence of such aAb-IL6 is increased in type 2 diabetic patients and that aAb-IL6 plays a direct role in causing hyperglycemia. In humans, the prevalence of circulating high-affinity neutralizing aAb-IL6 was 2.5% in the type 2 diabetic patients and 1% in the controls (odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.2 - 4.9, P=0.01). To test for the role of aAb-IL6 in causing hyperglycemia, such aAb-IL6 were induced in mice by a validated vaccination procedure. Mice with plasma levels of aAb-IL6 similar to the 2.5% type 2 diabetic patients developed obesity and impaired glucose tolerance (area under the curve (AUC) glucose, 2056±62 vs 1793±62, P=0.05) as compared with sham-vaccinated mice, when challenged with a high-fat diet. Mice with very high plasma levels of aAb-IL6 developed elevated fasting plasma glucose (mM, 4.8±0.4 vs 3.3±0.1, P<0.001) and impaired glucose tolerance (AUC glucose, 1340±38 vs 916±25, P<0.001) as compared with sham-control mice on normal chow. In conclusion, the prevalence of plasma aAb-IL6 at levels known to impair IL6 signaling in vivo is increased 2.5-fold in people with type 2 diabetes. In mice, matching levels of aAb-IL6 cause obesity and hyperglycemia. These data suggest that a small subset of type 2 diabetes may in part evolve from an autoimmune attack against IL6. "

We report exome sequencing of 200 individuals from Denmark with targeted capture of 18,654 coding genes and sequence coverage of each individual exome at an average depth of 12-fold. On average, about 95% of the target regions were covered by at least one read. We identified 121,870 SNPs in the sample population, including 53,081 coding SNPs (cSNPs). Using a statistical method for SNP calling and an estimation of allelic frequencies based on our population data, we derived the allele frequency spectrum of cSNPs with a minor allele frequency greater than 0.02. We identified a 1.8-fold excess of deleterious, non-syonomyous cSNPs over synonymous cSNPs in the low-frequency range (minor allele frequencies between 2% and 5%). This excess was more pronounced for X-linked SNPs, suggesting that deleterious substitutions are primarily recessive. "

  abstract: "As all four meiotic products give rise to sperm in males, female meiosis result in a single egg in most eukaryotes. Any genetic element with the potential to influence chromosome segregation, so that it is preferentially included in the egg, should therefore gain a transmission advantage; a process termed female meiotic drive. We are aware of two chromosomal components, centromeres and telomeres, which share the potential to influence chromosome movement during meioses and make the following predictions based on the presence of female meiotic drive: (1) centromere-binding proteins should experience rapid evolution as a result of a conflict between driving centromeres and the rest of the genome; and (2) segregation patterns should be skewed near centromeres and telomeres. To test these predictions, we first analyze the molecular evolution of seven centromere-binding proteins in nine divergent bird species. We find strong evidence for positive selection in two genes, lending support to the genomic conflict hypothesis. Then, to directly test for the presence of segregation distortion, we also investigate the transmission of 9000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 197 chicken families. By simulating fair Mendelian meioses, we locate chromosomal regions with statistically significant transmission ratio distortion. One region is located near the centromere on chromosome 1 and a second region is located near the telomere on the p-arm of chromosome 1. Although these observations do not provide conclusive evidence in favour of the meiotic drive/genome conflict hypothesis, they do lend support to the hypothesis that centromeres and telomeres drive during female meioses in chicken.

USH is divided into three types, USH1, USH2 and USH3, depending on the age of onset, the course of the disease, and on the degree of vestibular dysfunction. By homozygosity mapping of a consanguineous Danish family of Dutch descent, we have identified a novel locus for a rare USH3-like syndrome. The affected family members have a unique association of retinitis pigmentosa, progressive hearing impairment, vestibular dysfunction, and congenital cataract. The phenotype is similar, but not identical to that of USH3 patients, as congenital cataract has not been reported for USH3. By homozygosity mapping, we identified a 7.3 Mb locus on chromosome 15q22.2-23 with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 2.0. The locus partially overlaps with the USH1 locus, USH1H, a novel unnamed USH2 locus, and the non-syndromic deafness locus DFNB48. "

  abstract: "OBJECTIVE - Genome-wide association studies and linkage studies have identified 20 validated genetic variants associated with obesity and/or related phenotypes. The variants are common, and they individually exhibit small-to-modest effect sizes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - In this study we investigate the combined effect of these variants and their ability to discriminate between normal weight and overweight/obese individuals. We applied receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and estimated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a measure of the discriminatory ability. The analyses were performed cross-sectionally in the population-based Inter99 cohort where 1,725 normal weight, 1,519 overweight, and 681 obese individuals were successfully genotyped for all 20 variants. RESULTS - When combining all variants, the 10% of the study participants who carried more than 22 risk-alleles showed a significant increase in probability of being both overweight with an odds ratio of 2.00 (1.47-2.72), P = 4.0 × 10 -5, and obese with an OR of 2.62 (1.76-3.92), P = 6.4 × 10 -7, compared with the 10% of the study participants who carried less than 14 risk-alleles. Discrimination ability for overweight and obesity, using the 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), was determined to AUCs of 0.53 and 0.58, respectively. When combining SNP data with conventional nongenetic risk factors of obesity, the discrimination ability increased to 0.64 for overweight and 0.69 for obesity. The latter is significantly higher (P < 0.001) than for the nongenetic factors alone (AUC = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS - The discriminative value of the 20 validated common obesity variants is at present time sparse and too weak for clinical utility, however, they add to increase the discrimination ability of conventional nongenetic risk factors.

  abstract: "Past demographic changes can produce distortions in patterns of genetic variation that can mimic the appearance of natural selection unless the demographic effects are explicitly removed. Here we fit a detailed model of human demography that incorporates divergence, migration, admixture, and changes in population size to directly sequenced data from 13,400 protein coding genes from 20 European-American and 19 African-American individuals. Based on this demographic model, we use several new and established statistical methods for identifying genes with extreme patterns of polymorphism likely to be caused by Darwinian selection, providing the first genome-wide analysis of allele frequency distributions in humans based on directly sequenced data. The tests are based on observations of excesses of high frequency-derived alleles, excesses of low frequency-derived alleles, and excesses of differences in allele frequencies between populations. We detect numerous new genes with strong evidence of selection, including a number of genes related to psychiatric and other diseases. We also show that microRNA controlled genes evolve under extremely high constraints and are more likely to undergo negative selection than other genes. Furthermore, we show that genes involved in muscle development have been subject to positive selection during recent human history. In accordance with previous studies, we find evidence for negative selection against mutations in genes associated with Mendelian disease and positive selection acting on genes associated with several complex diseases.

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: The suppressor of cytokine signalling 1 (SOCS1) is a natural inhibitor of cytokine and insulin signalling pathways and may also play a role in obesity. In addition, SOCS1 is considered a candidate gene in the pathogenesis of both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The objective was to perform mutation analysis of SOCS1 and to test the identified variations for association to T2D-related quantitative traits, T2D or T1D. Methods: Mutation scanning was performed by direct sequencing in 27 white Danish subjects. Genotyping was carried out by TaqMan allelic discrimination. A total of more than 8100 individuals were genotyped. Results: Eight variations were identified in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) region. Two of these had allele frequencies below 1% and were not further examined. The six other variants were analysed in groups of T1D families (n=1461 subjects) and T2D patients (n=1430), glucose tolerant first-degree relatives of T2D patients (n=212) and normal glucose tolerant (NGT) subjects. The rs33977706 polymorphism (-820G>T) was associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) (p=0.004). In a second study (n=4625 NGT subjects), significant associations of both the rs33977706 and the rs243330 (-1656G>A) variants to obesity were found (p=0.047 and p=0.015) respectively. The rs33977706 affected both binding of a nuclear protein to and the transcriptional activity of the SOCS1 promoter, indicating a relationship between this polymorphism and gene regulation. Conclusions/interpretation: This study demonstrates that functional variations in the SOCS1 promoter may associate with alterations in BMI in the general white population. "

  abstract: "In applied statistics, tools from machine learning are popular for analyzing complex and high-dimensional data. However, few theoretical results are available that could guide to the appropriate machine learning tool in a new application. Initial development of an overall strategy thus often implies that multiple methods are tested and compared on the same set of data. This is particularly difficult in situations that are prone to over-fitting where the number of subjects is low compared to the number of potential predictors. The article presents a game which provides some grounds for conducting a fair model comparison. Each player selects a modeling strategy for predicting individual response from potential predictors. A strictly proper scoring rule, bootstrap cross-validation, and a set of rules are used to make the results obtained with different strategies comparable. To illustrate the ideas, the game is applied to data from the Nugenob Study where the aim is to predict the fat oxidation capacity based on conventional factors and high-dimensional metabolomics data. Three players have chosen to use support vector machines, LASSO, and random forests, respectively. "

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: The list of validated type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants has recently been expanded from three to 19. The variants identified are common and have low penetrance in the general population. The aim of the study is to investigate the combined effect of the 19 variants by applying receiver operating characteristics (ROC) to demonstrate the discriminatory value between glucose-tolerant individuals and type 2 diabetes patients in a cross-sectional population of Danes. Methods: The 19 variants were genotyped in three study populations: the population-based Inter99 study; the ADDITION study; and additional type 2 diabetic patients and glucose-tolerant individuals. The case-control studies involved 4,093 type 2 diabetic patients and 5,302 glucose-tolerant individuals. Results: Single-variant analyses demonstrated allelic odds ratios ranging from 1.04 (95% CI 0.98-1.11) to 1.33 (95% CI 1.22-1.45). When combining the 19 variants, subgroups with extreme risk profiles showed a threefold difference in the risk of type 2 diabetes (lower 10% carriers with ≤ 15 risk alleles vs upper 10% carriers with ≥ 22 risk alleles, OR 2.93 (95% CI 2.38-3.62, p∈=∈1.6∈×∈10 -25). We calculated the area under a ROC curve to estimate the discrimination rate between glucose-tolerant individuals and type 2 diabetes patients based on the 19 variants. We found an area under the ROC curve of 0.60. Two-way gene-gene interaction showed few nominal interaction effects. Conclusions/interpretation: Combined analysis of the 19 validated variants enables detection of subgroups at substantially increased risk of type 2 diabetes; however, the discrimination between glucose-tolerant and type 2 diabetes individuals is still too inaccurate to achieve clinical value.

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: An association between elevated fasting plasma glucose and the common rs560887 G allele in the G6PC2/ABCB11 locus has been reported. In Danes we aimed to examine rs560887 in relation to plasma glucose and serum insulin responses following oral and i.v. glucose loads and in relation to hepatic glucose production during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Furthermore, we examined rs560887 for association with impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), type 2 diabetes and components of the metabolic syndrome. Methods: rs560887 was genotyped in the Inter99 cohort (n=5,899), in 366 young, healthy Danes, in non-diabetic relatives of type 2 diabetic patients (n=196), and in young and elderly twins (n=159). Participants underwent an OGTT, an IVGTT or a 2 h hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. Results: The rs560887 G allele associated with elevated fasting plasma glucose (p=2×10-14) but not with plasma glucose levels at 30 min (p=0.9) or 120 min (p=0.9) during an OGTT. G allele carriers had elevated levels of serum insulin at 30 min during an OGTT (p=1×10-4) and relatives of type 2 diabetes patients carrying the G allele had an increased acute insulin response (p=4×10-4) during an IVGTT. Among elderly twins, G allele carriers had higher basal hepatic glucose production (p=0.04). Finally, the G allele associated with the risk of having IFG (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.08-1.47, p=0.002), but not with IGT (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.08, p=0.4) or type 2 diabetes (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84-1.04, p=0.2). Conclusions/ interpretation: The common rs560887 G allele in the G6PC2/ABCB11 locus is associated with increased fasting glycaemia and increased risk of IFG, associations that may be partly related to an increased basal hepatic glucose production rate.

  abstract: "BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ-line mutations predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. Large genomic rearrangements of BRCA1 account for 0-36% of all disease causing mutations in various populations, while large genomic rearrangements in BRCA2 are more rare. We examined 642 East Danish breast and/or ovarian cancer patients in whom a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 and BRCA2 was not detected by sequencing using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay. We identified 15 patients with 7 different genomic rearrangements, including a BRCA1 exon 5-7 deletion with a novel breakpoint, a BRCA1 exon 13 duplication, a BRCA1 exon 17-19 deletion, a BRCA1 exon 3-16 deletion, and a BRCA2 exon 20 deletion with a novel breakpoint as well as two novel BRCA1 exon 17-18 and BRCA1 exon 19 deletions. The large rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 accounted for 9.2% (15/163) of all BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in East Denmark. Nine patients had the exon 3-16 deletion in BRCA1. By SNP analysis we find that the patients share a 5 Mb fragment of chromosome 17, including BRCA1, indicating that the exon 3-16 deletion represents a Danish founder mutation. "

  abstract: "Estimates of relatedness have several applications such as the identification of relatives or in identifying disease related genes through identity by descent (IBD) mapping. Here we present a new method for identifying IBD tracts among individuals from genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms data. We use a continuous time Markov model where the hidden states are the number of alleles shared IBD between pairs of individuals at a given position. In contrast to previous methods, our method accurately accounts for linkage disequilibrium using pairwise haplotype probabilities. The method provides a map of the local relatedness along the genome. We illustrate the potential of the method for mapping disease genes on a real data set, and show that the method has the potential to map causative disease mutations using only a handful of affected individuals. The new IBD mapping method provides considerable improvement in mapping power in natural populations compared to standard association mapping methods. "

  abstract: "Genome-wide association studies have identified common variants that only partially explain the genetic risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Using genome-wide association data from 1,376 French individuals, we identified 16,360 SNPs nominally associated with T2D and studied these SNPs in an independent sample of 4,977 French individuals. We then selected the 28 best hits for replication in 7,698 Danish subjects and identified 4 SNPs showing strong association with T2D, one of which (rs2943641, P = 9.3 × 10 12, OR = 1.19) was located adjacent to the insulin receptor substrate 1 gene (IRS1). Unlike previously reported T2D risk loci, which predominantly associate with impaired beta cell function, the C allele of rs2943641 was associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia in 14,358 French, Danish and Finnish participants from population-based cohorts; this allele was also associated with reduced basal levels of IRS1 protein and decreased insulin induction of IRS1-associated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase activity in human skeletal muscle biopsies.

  abstract: "Germ-line mutations in the tumour suppressor proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. We examined 32 breast and/or ovarian cancer patients from Greenland for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Whereas no mutations were identified in 19 families, 13 families exhibited a BRCA1 exon 3 nucleotide 234 T > G mutation, which has not previously been reported in the breast cancer information core (BIC) database. The mutation changes a conserved cysteine 39 to a glycine in the Zn2+ site II of the RING domain, which is essential for BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity. Eight of the families had members with ovarian cancer, suggesting that the RING domain may be an ovarian cancer hotspot. By SNP array analysis, we find that all 13 families share a 4.5 Mb genomic fragment containing the BRCA1 gene, showing that the mutation originates from a founder. Finally, analysis of 1152 Inuit, representing almost ~2% of the total Greenlandic Inuit population, showed that the frequency of the mutation was 1.0%. We conclude that the BRCA1 nucleotide 234 T > G is a common Greenlandic Inuit founder mutation. The relative high frequency in the general population, together with the ease of screening and possibility to reduce mortality in gene carriers, may warrant screening of the Greenlandic Inuit population. Provided screening is efficient, about 5% of breast- and 13% of ovarian cancers, respectively, may be prevented. "

  abstract: "Context: Hepatic lipase plays a pivotal role in the metabolism of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein by involvement in reverse cholesterol transport and the formation of atherogenic small dense low-density lipoprotein. Objectives: The objective was to investigate the impact of variants in LIPC on metabolic traits and type 2 diabetes in a large sample of Danes. Because behavioral factors influence hepatic lipase activity, we furthermore examined possible gene-environment interactions in the population-based Inter99 study. Design: The LIPC - 250G>A (rs2070895) variant was genotyped in the Inter99 study (n = 6070), the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care Denmark screening cohort of individuals with risk factors for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes (n = 8662), and in additional type 2 diabetic patients (n = 1,064) and glucose-tolerant control subjects (n = 360). Results: In the Inter99 study, the A allele of rs2070895 associated with a 0.057 mmol/liter [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.039-0.075] increase in fasting serum HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) (P = 8 × 10-10) supported by association in the Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care study [0.038 mmol/liter per allele (95% CI 0.024-0.053); P = 2 × 10-7). The allelic effect on HDL-c was modulated by interaction with self-reported physical activity (Pinteraction = 0.002) because vigorous physically active homozygous A-allele carriers had a 0.30 mmol/liter (95% CI 0.22-0.37) increase in HDL-c compared with homozygous G-allele carriers. Conclusions: We validate the association of LIPC promoter variation with fasting serum HDL-c and present data supporting an interaction with physical activity implying an increased effect on HDL-c in vigorous physically active subjects carrying the -250 A allele. This interaction may have potential implications for public health and disease prevention. Copyright "

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: Recent genome-wide association studies have suggested that a polymorphism in GCKR, the gene encoding the glucokinase regulatory protein, is involved in triacylglycerol regulation. Our aim was to examine in large-scale studies the common GCKR rs780094 polymorphism in relation to metabolic traits (mainly fasting hypertriacylglycerolaemia) and traits related to pancreatic beta cell function. Methods: The polymorphism was genotyped in 16,853 Danes using Taqman allelic discrimination. Association was analysed in case-control studies and quantitative trait analyses. We also analysed the possible interactive effect between the GCK -30G>A polymorphism and the GCKR rs780094 variant on metabolic traits. Results: The minor GCKR A-allele of rs780094 is associated with an increased level of fasting serum triacylglycerol (p = 6 × 10 -14), impaired fasting (p = 0.001) and OGTT-related insulin release (p = 3 × 10-6), reduced homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (p = 0.0004), WHO-defined dyslipidaemia (p = 6 × 10 -9) and a modestly decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (p = 0.01). Significantly increased fasting serum insulin concentrations were demonstrated when analysing the GCK -30A and GCKR rs780094 G-alleles in an additive model. Conclusions/interpretation: The GCKR rs780094 polymorphism, or another variant with which it is in tight linkage disequilibrium, is likely to increase glucokinase regulatory protein activity to induce improved glycaemic regulation at the expense of hypertriacylglycerolaemia as reflected in the present study of 16,853 Danes. We also suggest an additive effect of GCK and GCKR risk alleles on plasma glucose and serum insulin release. "

  abstract: "Background: BRCA2 germ-line mutations predispose to breast and ovarian cancer. Mutations are widespread and unclassified splice variants are frequently encountered. We describe the parental origin and functional characterization of a novel de novo BRCA2 splice site mutation found in a patient exhibiting a ductal carcinoma at the age of 40. Methods: Variations were identified by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and sequencing of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The effect of the mutation on splicing was examined by exon trapping in COS-7 cells and by RT-PCR on RNA isolated from whole blood. The paternity was determined by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis. Parental origin of the de novo mutation was determined by establishing mutation-SNP haplotypes by variant specific PCR, while de novo and mosaic status was investigated by sequencing of DNA from leucocytes and carcinoma tissue. Results: A novel BRCA2 variant in the splice donor site of exon 21 (nucleotide 8982+1 G→A/c.8754+1 G→A) was identified. Exon trapping showed that the mutation activates a cryptic splice site 46 base pairs 3′ of exon 21, resulting in the inclusion of a premature stop codon and synthesis of a truncated BRCA2 protein. The aberrant splicing was verified by RT-PCR analysis on RNA isolated from whole blood of the affected patient. The mutation was not found in any of the patient's parents or in the mother's carcinoma, showing it is a de novo mutation. Variant specific PCR indicates that the mutation arose in the male germ-line. Conclusion: We conclude that the novel BRCA2 splice variant is a de novo mutation introduced in the male spermatozoa that can be classified as a disease causing mutation. "

  abstract: "OBJECTIVE - Three independent studies have shown that variation in the fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene associates with BMI and obesity. In the present study, the effect of FTO variation on metabolic traits including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related quantitative phenotypes was examined. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The FTO rs9939609 polymorphism was genotyped in a total of 17,508 Danes from five different study groups. RESULTS - In studies of 3,856 type 2 diabetic case subjects and 4,861 normal glucose-tolerant control subjects, the minor A-allele of rs9939609 associated with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.13 [95% CI 1.06-1.20], P = 9 × 10-5). This association was abolished when adjusting for BMI (1.06 [0.97-1.16], P = 0.2). Among 17,162 middle-aged Danes, the A-allele associated with overweight (1.19 [1.13-1.24], P = 1 × 10-12) and obesity (1.27 [1.20-1.34], P = 2 × 10-16). Furthermore, obesity-related quantitative traits such as body weight, waist circumference, fat mass, and fasting serum leptin levels were significantly elevated in A-allele carriers. An interaction between the FTO rs9939609 genotype and physical activity (P = 0.007) was found, where physically inactive homozygous risk A-allele carriers had a 1.95 ± 0.3 kg/m 2 increase in BMI compared with homozygous T-allele carriers. CONCLUSIONS - We validate that variation in FTO is associated with type 2 diabetes when not adjusted for BMI and with an overall increase in body fat mass. Furthermore, low physical activity seems to accentuate the effect of FTO rs9939609 on body fat accumulation. "

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We genotyped the six variants in 4,516 middle-aged glucose-tolerant individuals of the population-based Inter99 cohort who were all characterized by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). RESULTS-Homozygous carriers of the minor diabetes risk G-allele of the CDC123/CAMK1D rs12779790 showed an 18% decrease in insulinogenic index (95% CI 10-27%; P = 4 X 10-5), an 18% decrease in corrected insulin response (CIR) (8.1-29%; P = 4 X 10-4), and a 13% decrease in the ratio of area under the serum-insulin and plasma-glucose curves during an OGTT (AUC- insubn/AUC-glucose) (5.8-20%; P = 4 X 10-4). Carriers of the diabetes-associated T-allele of JAZF1 rs864745 had an allele- dependent 3% decrease in BIGTT-AIR (0.9-4.3%; P = 0.003). Furthermore, the diabetes-associated C-allele of TSPAN8 rs7961581 associated with decreased levels of CIR (4.5% [0.5-8.4]; P = 0.03), of AUC-insubn/AUC-glucose ratio (3.9% [1.2-6.7]; P = 0.005), and of the insulinogenic index (5.2% [1.9-8.6]; P = 0.002). No association with traits of insulin release or insulin action was observed for the THADA, ADAMTS9,or NOTCH2 variants. CONCLUSIONS-If replicated, our data suggest that type 2 diabetes at-risk alleles in the JAZF1, CDC123/CAMK1D, and TSPAN8 loci associate with various OGTT-based surrogate measures of insulin release, emphasizing the contribution of abnormal pancreatic (3-ceb function in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

  abstract: "Aim/hypothesis: Recently, variants in WFS1 have been shown to be associated with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to examine metabolic risk phenotypes of WFS1 variants in glucose-tolerant people and in individuals with abnormal glucose regulation. Methods: The type 2 diabetes-associated WFS1 variant rs734312 (His611Arg) was studied in the population-based Inter99 cohort involving 4,568 glucose-tolerant individuals and 1,471 individuals with treatment-naive abnormal glucose regulation, and in an additional 3,733 treated type 2 diabetes patients. Results: The WFS1 rs734312 showed a borderline significant association with type 2 diabetes with directions and relative risks consistent with previous reports. In individuals with abnormal glucose regulation, the diabetogenic risk A allele of rs734312 was associated in an allele-dependent manner with a decrease in insulinogenic index (p=0.025) and decreased 30-min serum insulin levels (p=0.047) after an oral glucose load. In glucose-tolerant individuals the same allele was associated with increased fasting serum insulin concentration (p=0.019) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; p=0.026). To study the complex interaction of WFS1 rs734312 on insulin release and insulin resistance we introduced Hotelling's T 2 test. Assuming bivariate normal distribution, we constructed standard error ellipses of the insulinogenic index and HOMA-IR when stratified according to glucose tolerance status around the means of each WFS1 rs734312 genotype level. The interaction term between individuals with normal glucose tolerance and abnormal glucose regulation on the insulinogenic index and HOMA-IR was significantly associated with the traits (p=0.0017). Conclusions/interpretation: Type 2 diabetes-associated risk alleles of WFS1 are associated with estimates of a decreased pancreatic beta cell function among middle-aged individuals with abnormal glucose regulation.

  abstract: "Context: The type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (D2) catalyzes the conversion of T4 to the active form of thyroid hormone, which is a critical regulator of thermogenesis and glucose metabolism. A Thr92Ala polymorphism in the gene encoding D2 (DIO2) has been reported to associate with insulin resistance. Objective: The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of the DIO2 Thr92Ala variant on type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and related quantitative metabolic traits including measures of insulin resistance. Because DIO2 is activated through a β-adrenergic receptor-dependent pathway, we further hypothesized that variation in the ADRB genes interacts with DIO2 Thr92Ala variant to influence metabolic traits. Design and Patients: The DIO2 polymorphism was genotyped in a total of 7342 white subjects including 1405 T2D patients. Results: We detected no significant association of the DIO2 Thr92Ala polymorphism with T2D or obesity. We observed nominal significant associations of genotype with increased area under the serum insulin curve during an oral glucose tolerance test (P = 0.03) and elevated fasting plasma glucose (P = 0.02) in homozygous Ala92 allele carriers, the latter strengthened by epistasis with the ADRB2 Gly16Arg variant in a double recessive model (P = 0.004). However, after permutation procedure, performed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing, the associations did not reach studywide significance. Conclusions: The DIO2 Thr92Ala variant does not confer an increased risk of T2D, obesity, or insulin resistance. Copyright "

  abstract: "Aims: The glutamate decarboxylase gene (GAD2) encodes GAD65, an enzyme catalysing the production of the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) which interacts with neuropeptide Y to stimulate food intake. It has been suggested that in pancreatic islets, GABA serves as a functional regulator of pancreatic hormone release. Conflicting results have been reported concerning the potential impact of GAD2 variation on estimates of energy metabolism. The aim of this study was to elucidate potential associations between the GAD2 -243A→G polymorphism and levels of body mass index (BMI) and estimates of glycaemia. Methods: Using high-throughput chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the GAD2 -243A→G (rs2236418) polymorphism was genotyped in a population-based sample (Inter99) of 5857 middle-aged, unrelated Danish White subjects. Results: The G-allele was associated with modestly lower BMI (P = 0.01). In a case-control study of obesity, the G-allele frequency in 2582 participants with BMI < 25 kg/m 2 was 19.5% (18.4-20.6) compared with 17.1% (15.5-18.8) in 968 participants having BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 (P = 0.03), odds ratio 0.9 (0.7-1.0). Of the 5857 subjects, GG carriers had lower fasting plasma glucose levels (mmol/l) [AA (n = 3859) 5.6 ± 0.8; AG (n = 1792) 5.5 ± 0.8; GG (n = 206) 5.5 ± 0.8, P = 0.008] and lower 30-min oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-related plasma glucose levels (AA 8.7 ± 1.9; AG 8.6 ± 1.9; GG 8.6 ± 2.0, P = 0.04), adjusted for sex, age and BMI. Analysing subjects who were both normoglycaemic and glucose tolerant (n = 4431) GG carriers still had lower fasting plasma glucose concentrations: AA (n = 2895) 5.3 ± 0.4; AG (n = 1383) 5.3 ± 0.4; GG (n = 153) 5.2 ± 0.4 (P = 9.10-5). Conclusion: The present study suggests that the GAD2 -243A→G polymorphism in a population of middle-aged White people associates with a modest reduction in BMI and fasting and OGTT-related plasma glucose levels.

  abstract: "For most common diseases with heritable components, not a single or a few single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) explain most of the variance for these disorders. Instead, much of the variance may be caused by interactions (epistasis) among multiple SNPs or interactions with environmental conditions. We present a new powerful statistical model for analyzing and interpreting genomic data that influence multifactorial phenotypic traits with a complex and likely polygenic inheritance. The new method is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and allows for identification of sets of SNPs and environmental factors that when combined increase disease risk or change the distribution of a quantitative trait. Using simulations, we show that the MCMC method can detect disease association when multiple, interacting SNPs are present in the data. When applying the method on real large-scale data from a Danish population-based cohort, multiple interactions are identified that severely affect serum triglyceride levels in the study individuals. The method is designed for quantitative traits but can also be applied on qualitative traits. It is computationally feasible even for a large number of possible interactions and differs fundamentally from most previous approaches by entertaining nonlinear interactions and by directly addressing the multiple-testing problem.

  abstract: "Background: The estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα or NR3B1) is a transcription factor from the nuclear receptor super-family, group III. The gene encoding ERRα (ESRRA) is located on chromosome 11q13, a region showing genetic linkage to body mass index and fat percentage. Through interaction with the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), ERRα regulates key enzymes involved in the β-oxidation of fatty acids. Results: By screening 48 overweight or obese subjects for variants in the exons, exon-intron boundaries and 1000 base pairs (bp) of the promoter region of ESRRA using bi-directional nucleotide sequencing, we identified seven variants. Four rare variants had minor allele frequencies (MAF) below 1%: Pro369Pro, Gly406Asp, 3′UTR+418G>A, 3′UTR+505C>A. Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms, Pro116Pro and IVS6+65C>T (MAF 15%), were in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r 2=1). We also confirmed the presence of a reported 23 bp microsatellite repeat (ESRRA23). The Pro116Pro and ESRRA23 variants were not associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes or related phenotypes in a large population-based study of 6365 Danish whites. The two variants were examined for interactions with variants in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α and -β; however, no evidence of epistatic effects between the variants was demonstrated. Conclusion: The ESRRA23 and Pro116Pro variants of the gene encoding ERRα are not associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes or related quantitative traits in the examined Danish whites. "

  abstract: "OBJECTIVE - In the present study, we aimed to validate the type 2 diabetes susceptibility alleles identified in six recent genome-wide association studies in the HHEX/KIF11/IDE (rs1111875), CDKN2A/B (rs10811661), and IGF2BP2 (rs4402960) loci, as well as the intergenic rs9300039 variant. Furthermore, we aimed to characterize quantitative metabolic risk phenotypes of the four variants. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The variants were genotyped in the population-based Inter99 cohort (n = 5,970), the ADDITION Study (n = 1,626), a population-based sample of young healthy subjects (n = 377), and in additional type 2 diabetic case (n = 2,111) and glucose-tolerant (n = 521) subjects. The case-control studies involved a total of 4,089 type 2 diabetic patients and 5,043 glucose-tolerant control subjects. RESULTS - We validated association of variants near HHEX/ KIF11/IDE, CDKN2A/B, and IGF2BP2 with type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, in middle-aged people, the rs1111875 C-allele of HHEX/KIF11/IDE strongly associated with lower acute insulin response during an oral glucose tolerance test (P = 6 × 10-7). In addition, decreased insulin release following intravenous tolbutamide injection was observed in young healthy subjects (P = 0.02). Also, a reduced insulin release was observed for the CDKN2A/B rs10811661 T-allele after both oral and intravenous glucose challenges (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS - We validate that variants in the proximity of the HHEX/KIF11/IDE, CDKN2A/B, and IFG2BP2 loci associate with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, variations within the HHEX/KIF11/IDE and CDKN2A/B loci confer impaired glucose- and tolbutamide-induced insulin release in middle-aged and young healthy subjects, suggesting a role for these variants in the pathogenesis of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction.

  abstract: "Aims: Activation of the β1-adrenergic receptor (ADRB1) causes increased lipolysis in adipose tissue and enhances cardiac output. Analysis of the association of the functional ADRB1 Arg389Gly variant with obesity and hypertension has given ambiguous results. To clarify the potential impact of this variant on obesity and hypertension in the general population, we examined the Arg389Gly variant in a relatively large-scale population-based study. Methods: Case-control studies and quantitative trait analyses were carried out in 7677 Danish Caucasians who were genotyped for the Arg389Gly variant (dbSNP rs1801253) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Results: A weak association between the Gly allele of the Arg389Gly variant and obesity was observed when comparing cases (n = 1540) defined as body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m2 with control subjects (n = 6108) defined as BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2 for both allele frequencies (P = 0.05) and genotype distribution (P = 0.05). Case-control studies (cases n = 2518; control n = 3981) examining the effect on hypertension showed no association with allele frequencies (P = 0.3) or genotype distribution (P = 0.5); however, in the quantitative trait analyses, individuals carrying the Gly allele had slightly but significantly lower diastolic (Arg/Arg = 81.9 mmHg vs. Gly-allele carriers = 81.5 mmHg) and systolic (Arg/Arg = 129.4 mmHg vs. Gly-allele carriers = 128.8 mmHg) blood pressure as well as a lower mean arterial blood pressure. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the Arg389Gly polymorphism does not have any clinically important impact on the pathogenesis of obesity in Danish white subjects. Furthermore, despite the observed minor influence on blood pressure, this variant is most likely not to be a major contributor to the development of hypertension. "

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: Studies in animals reveal that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) regulates glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in both the liver and skeletal muscles. Moreover, PPARδ augments physical endurance and increases oxidative metabolism, thereby averting obesity. Thus, we hypothesised that common variation in the PPARD gene is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic traits. Materials and methods: We studied variation in the exonic region of PPARD. Based upon the results of variant detection and information derived from the HapMap data resource, we selected common variants and tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms for genotyping in 7,495 white subjects, including 1,416 patients with type 2 diabetes. Results: Fourteen nucleotide variants were identified and a total of 12 variants capturing the common variation of PPARD were genotyped. In the population-based Inter99 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID no: NCT00289237) sample we observed no robust association with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), adiposity measures or fasting serum lipids. Similarly, no association with type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome was found. Conclusions/interpretation: Based on thorough investigation, we conclude that common variation in PPARD does not significantly affect the risk of metabolic disease in the population studied. Given the confidence intervals that were found for effect size estimates, we can effectively rule out an increase in HOMA-IR of any tag SNP above 7% per allele, assuming an additive model. Likewise, we can exclude an odds ratio of type 2 diabetes above 1.27 per allele. "

  abstract: "Recently, it has been shown that mutations in the P2 promoter of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4α gene (HNF4A) cause maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), while single nucleotide polymorphisms in this locus are associated with type 2 diabetes. In this study, we examined 1,189 bp of the P2 promoter and the associated exon 1D of HNF4A for variations associated with diabetes in 114 patients with type 2 diabetes, 72 MODYX probands, and 85 women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus. A -192c/g mutation was found in five patients. We screened 1,587 diabetic subjects and 4,812 glucose-tolerant subjects for the -192c/g mutation and identified 5 diabetic and 1 glucose-tolerant mutation carriers (P = 0.004). Examination of the families showed that carriers of the -192c/g mutation had a significantly impaired glucosestimulated insulin release and lower levels of serum total cholesterol compared with matched control subjects. Furthermore, the mutation disrupted the binding of an unidentified sequence-specific DNA binding complex present in human islet extracts. Also, two novel linked polymorphisms in the P2 promoter at positions -1107g/t and -858c/t were identified. These variants were not significantly associated with type 2 diabetes or any pre-diabetic traits. In conclusion, a rare, novel mutation that disrupts a protein binding site in the pancreatic HNF4A promoter associates with late-onset diabetes. "

  abstract: "Aims: Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is a catalyst of the rate-limiting step in the gluconeogenic pathway and is regulated at the transcriptional level predominantly by insulin, glucocorticoids, glucagon, and cAMP. The -232C > G polymorphism in the gene encoding PEPCK (PCK1) is reported to associate with Type 2 diabetes in Canadian Caucasians and Oji-Cree populations. We have estimated the impact of the PCK1 -232C > G polymorphism in a relatively large-scale case-control study of Type 2 diabetes and in association studies of common metabolic phenotypes. Interaction studies of the PCK1 -232C > G polymorphism with variants in the genes encoding peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator (PGC)-1α and hepatic nuclear factor (HNF)-4α were also performed. Methods: PCK1 -232C > G was genotyped in a total of 7467 Danish white subjects using TaqMan allelic discrimination. A case-control study of Type 2 diabetes was performed using 6057 of the participants, and quantitative trait studies of metabolic variables were carried out in a subgroup of 5718 non-diabetic subjects. Additionally, variants in PGC-1α (Gly482Ser) and HNF-4α (Thr130Ile, Val255Met, and rs1884614) were investigated for epistatic interaction with the PCK1 -232C > G polymorphism. Results: In the case-control study of Type 2 diabetes of 1377 Type 2 diabetic patients and 4680 normoglycaemic and normal glucose-tolerant subjects we found no association of the PCK1 -232C > G polymorphism with diabetes. In addition, the variant was not associated with age of clinical onset of Type 2 diabetes. In the study of 5718 non-diabetic subjects, we found no relationships of quantitative metabolic traits with the PCK1 -232C > G polymorphism. We failed to demonstrate any convincing epistatic effects of the variants in the genes encoding PGC-1α and HNF-4α with the PCK1 -232C > G polymorphism. Conclusions: The PCK1 -232C > G polymorphism is not a major contributor to the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes in the Danish population. "

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: The gene encoding neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R) is widely expressed in the central nervous system, with particularly high abundance in the hypothalamus, which is known to be important for appetite regulation. We tested whether variations in NPY2R are associated with obesity. Methods: The coding region of NPY2R was analysed for mutations in 48 obese Danish white subjects and two silent substitutions were identified: SNPs 1 and 2 (rs1047214 and rs2880415). SNP1 and additional reported variants (SNPs 3-6 [rs11099992, rs12649641, rs2342676 and rs6857530]) located in the 5′ region were examined in 5,971 Danish white subjects. Since SNPs 1-2 and 4-6, respectively, were in tight linkage disequilibrium large-scale analyses of genetic epidemiology were restricted to SNPs 1, 3 and 4. Results: Homozygous carriers of the minor A allele of SNP4 were more common among obese subjects; the AA frequency was 15.9 (95% CI 15.2-16.6) among 4,837 non-obese subjects (BMI <30 kg/m2) vs 19.0 (95% CI 17.2-20.8) among 960 obese subjects (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), odds ratio 1.24 (95% CI 1.04-1.48), p=0.02. SNPs 1-3 were not associated with obesity. Conclusions/interpretation: Common variants rs12649641, rs2342676 and rs6857530 in the 5′ region of NPY2R are associated with obesity in Danish white subjects. "

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: Plasma cell membrane glycoprotein 1 (PC-1) inhibits insulin signalling by direct interaction with the insulin receptor α subunit. This inhibition is enhanced by the minor Q allele of the K121Q polymorphism (rs1044498) in the gene (ENPP1) encoding PC-1. This polymorphism has been studied in relation to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and obesity in several populations with conflicting results. We assessed the impact of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism on type 2 diabetes, obesity and quantitative metabolic traits in 7,333 Danes. Subjects and methods: The K121Q polymorphism was genotyped in the population-based Inter99 study cohort (5,961 subjects) and in a group of 1,386 patients with type 2 diabetes. All subjects were Danish whites. Results: No significant associations with type 2 diabetes or related quantitative metabolic traits, including measures of insulin resistance, were detected. However, a meta-analysis of the present and published studies revealed an association with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio per Q allele, 1.17 [95% CI 1.10-1.25], p=1×10-6). In case-control studies comparing subjects of different BMI strata, we observed a putative association of the codon 121 QQ genotype with being overweight (BMI>25 kg/m2; odds ratio 1.63 [95% CI 1.09-2.46], p=0.015), an association not observed when comparing other levels of BMI or when analysing BMI as a quantitative trait. Conclusions/interpretation: In a meta-analysis, the ENPP1 codon 121 Q allele associates with type 2 diabetes. However, a similar association was not found in the present study of Danish white subjects. The effect of this variant on obesity in Danish subjects is contentious and further study is needed. "

  abstract: "Aims/hypothesis: The 825C>T polymorphism in the gene encoding the G protein β3 subunit (GNB3) causes enhanced G protein activation and increased in vitro cell proliferation. This polymorphism is also repeatedly associated with an increased risk of hypertension and has been studied in relation to obesity with divergent results. Only a few association studies have investigated whether this polymorphism is related to type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. We estimated the impact of the GNB3 825C>T polymorphism in relatively large-scale association studies of common phenotypes of the metabolic syndrome. Materials and methods: The GNB3 825C>T polymorphism was genotyped in 7,518 white Danish subjects using mass spectrometry analysis of PCR products. Case-control studies were undertaken for obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and a meta-analysis including data from the present study and previous studies of hypertension was performed. Quantitative trait studies of metabolic variables were carried out in 4,387 glucose-tolerant subjects. Results: We observed minor differences in 825C>T genotype distributions for type 2 diabetes (CC/CT/TT 49/41/10% (control) vs 46/46/9% (cases), respectively, p=0.007); however, after correction for multiple testing, these were not statistically significant. No association was found with hypertension, obesity or the metabolic syndrome. Curiously, the T allele was associated with nominally lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels - a finding in contrast with most previous studies - but not with other metabolic variables. Meta-analysis demonstrated a high degree of heterogeneity between study populations of different ethnic origin. Although there was a tendency towards an increased risk of hypertension among 825T allele carriers, this was not statistically significant. Conclusions/interpretation: The present study suggests no major involvement of the GNB3 825C>T polymorphism in components of the metabolic syndrome. "
