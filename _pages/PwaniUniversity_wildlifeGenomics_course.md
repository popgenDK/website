# Content
The course is a comprehensive introduction to population genetics and the use of genomics tools especially in the context of wildlife research and conservation. All sessions will have hands-on data analysis.
Topics: fundamental population genetics, Next-generation sequencing, genomic data analysis, application of genomics to wildlife census, trafficking and population management

## Intended Learning Outcome
- Importance of population genetics and genomics in wildlife conservation and management
- Understand what NGS short-read data looks like when it comes from the sequencer, and have an overview of what needs to be done to it before population genetic analyses can be done. 
- Understand various measures of genetic diversity, inbreeding, population structure, relatedness
- Estimate demographic history and its consequnces for population survival or extinction
- Application of genomics in wildlife management
- Metagenomes and their analysis
